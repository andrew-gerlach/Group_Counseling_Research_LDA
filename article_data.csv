Examining racial microaggressions in group therapy and the buffering role of members’ perceptions of their group’s multicultural orientation,"Microaggressions have been found to occur at high rates within individual therapeutic dyads, and negatively impact therapeutic processes and outcomes for clients. However, there has been limited attention to the occurrence and impact of racial microaggressions in a group therapy context. Therefore, this study sought to examine the occurrence and impact of racial microaggressions on clients’ perceptions of group cohesion and improvement in group therapy, as well as the buffering role of members’ perceptions of their group’s multicultural orientation (MCO) on the impact of racial microaggressions. Data for this study consisted of 71 racial/ethnic minority (REM) clients across 38 interpersonal process therapy groups. Results indicated that 72% of participants reported experiencing at least 1 racial microaggression over the course of their group therapy experience. Contrary to our hypothesis, racial microaggressions were not associated with member’s perceptions of group cohesion or improvement. However, results indicated that REM members’ experiences of racial microaggressions had a stronger negative effect on their perceptions of group cohesion in groups with perceived low cultural comfort. This study documents the high prevalence of racial microaggressions in group therapy and the effect of the group’s MCO on the relationship between racial microaggressions and REM members’ perceptions of group cohesion.

Using the post-traumatic growth model to explore trauma narratives in group work with African refugee youth,"African American youth and African refugee youth encounter systemic racism in similar yet different ways. Because of the inherent traumatic experiences encountered by refugee youth, the added discrimination during their acculturation processes elevates their trauma and stressor-related symptoms. This paper uses the Posttraumatic Growth Model to explore some steps in facilitating an 8-week group therapy for African refugee youth in the US school system. Culturally-sensitive recommendations are also provided.

School-community group model: Collaborating for the empowerment of adolescent African American male students,"This article presents a conceptual School-Community Group Model for working with African American adolescents. The model stems from a group conducted with urban, male, African American, adolescents co-facilitated by a White female school counselor and an African American male community leader. The article describes the theoretical underpinnings for this approach, reviews the school-community collaboration literature, and the necessity of co-facilitation relationships grounded in trust and respect. A case example outlining group structure, session interventions, and the therapeutic benefits gained through effective co-facilitation across race and gender are discussed. Model limitations are identified, followed by provided practice, training, and research implications.

Problematic systems: Applying a multicultural orientation framework to understand “problematic members”,"Within the group therapy literature, individuals who behave in ways that are perceived as negatively impacting the group dynamic or process have commonly been referred to as problematic group members. Largely, this research has identified intrapsychic and interpersonal reasons for challenging client behaviors and provided clinical recommendations for challenging group work. However, this work has not considered a sociocultural and systems approach to understand the impact of systems of privilege and oppression on members’ in-group behaviors. In this paper we argue that members’ “problematic” in-group behaviors may in fact be a recapitulation of problematic systems of privilege and oppression that occur outside and within the therapy group. We provide evidence of the impact of cultural processes, and by extension, the impact of systems of privilege and oppression on group processes and outcomes. Finally, we provide clinical recommendations for addressing members’ problematic in-group behaviors from a multicultural orientation framework.

Italian adaptation of the Group Questionnaire: Validity and factorial structure,"The Group Questionnaire (GQ) is a measure recently developed by Krogel et al. (2013) for the evaluation of the therapeutic relationship in group. The GQ identifies a three-factor model of the relationship that allows to measure quality (Positive Bonding, Positive Working and Negative Relationship) and structure (member-member, member-leader and member-group), dimensions in group. This work shows the results of a first study on the Italian validation of the GQ. In this study the GQ was administered to 536 subjects from 32 non-clinical groups of undergraduate students. The cross-cultural validity of the GQ in the Italian population has been examined by comparing the psychometric properties and equivalence in factor structure and scores of the Italian GQ with the original American version. Multilevel confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine both the between- and within-group structures. Data concerning reliability and validity of GQ and the results for different SEM in Multilevel CFA confirm the three factors structure of the GQ. Data from the Italian population have a good fit with the original proposed model. Finally, we discuss the importance of an instrument like GQ, short but consistent, for the evaluation of the therapeutic relationship in clinical and training group.

Improving emotional competence in children with autism spectrum disorder and mild intellectual disability in schools: A preliminary treatment versus waitlist study,"This pilot study evaluated the effectiveness of delivering a new cognitive behavioural intervention package ‘Emotion-Based Social Skills Training (EBSST) for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Mild Intellectual Disability (ASD + MID)’ in schools. Fourteen school counsellors nominated 75 children (aged 7–13 years) with ASD + MID to receive 16 sessions of EBSST in groups of 3–8 children in their schools. Parent and teacher pre-post ratings of emotional competence (Emotions Development Questionnaire), social skills (Social Skills Improvement System Rating Scales) and mental health (Developmental Behaviour Checklist) were collected. Forty-three children received 16 sessions of EBSST and 32 children were allocated to the 9-month waitlist control group. Teachers and parents also received six EBSST training sessions in separate groups at school. Significant improvements in parent and teacher ratings of emotional competence were found at posttreatment among children in the EBSST group relative to controls; however, the results were not significant after the Bonferroni adjustment. Small to medium effect sizes were found. No difference in untrained social skills or mental health was observed. This study provides preliminary support for the utility of EBSST in teaching emotional competence skills for children with ASD + MID in schools and provides valuable pilot data for future research.

Enhancing late-career management among aging employees—A randomized controlled trial,"Our study investigates the long-term effects of a resource-based group intervention designed to strengthen older employees' late-career management preparedness on their perceptions of age discrimination, work engagement and future time perspective at work. A randomly assigned field experimental study (RCT) was carried out in 17 organizations representing both the private and public sectors. The data consisted of 699 employees with a mean age of 58. The results of the mixed-effects models revealed that the proximal effect of the intervention was increased late-career management preparedness. This in turn, reduced perceived age discrimination, strengthened work engagement and enhanced future time perspective at work, all of which was seen at six-month follow-up. The intervention was the most beneficial among aging employees with a lower-level education and those with a younger supervisor. On the basis of our results, we recommend resource-based peer group techniques for strengthening career management among aging employees, as it seems to enhance sustainability of their working careers.

The detrimental effect of fragile groups: Examining the role of cultural comfort for group therapy members of color,"Scholars have underscored the importance of cultural processes within therapy groups, but there is a paucity of empirical research on this topic. Recently, the multicultural orientation framework was applied to group therapy to address this limitation and empirically test the role of cultural comfort, cultural humility, and cultural opportunities in a group context. Despite this advancement, a more nuanced understanding of the differential effects of cultural processes based on group members’ race/ethnicity status is needed. Informed by theory and research on White fragility, this study sought to test the differential relationship between cultural comfort and cultural concealment, as well as cultural comfort and improvement, for 97 Racial-Ethnic Minority (REM) and 109 White members of 49 therapy groups. As hypothesized, REM status significantly moderated the association between cultural comfort and clients’ cultural concealment and improvement, such that cultural comfort was negatively associated with cultural concealment and positively associated with improvement in group therapy for REM clients but not White clients. Results and implications are discussed within a fragility framework.

Individual gender and group gender composition as predictors of differential benefit from mindfulness-based relapse prevention for substance use disorders,"Objectives: Mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) is an effective group-based aftercare treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs), yet few studies have examined moderators of MBRP efficacy. This secondary data analysis evaluated individual gender and group gender composition (e.g., proportion of women relative to men in each therapy group) as treatment moderators of MBRP. Methods: The analysis sample included 186 individuals with SUDs randomized to MBRP or relapse prevention (RP) as an aftercare treatment. Outcomes included number of heavy drinking days and drug use days at the 12-month follow-up. Results: There were no treatment moderation effects for models with heavy drinking days as the outcome (all ps &gt; .05). Group gender composition, but not individual gender, moderated the effect of treatment condition on drug use days ( p &lt; .01). Individuals who received MBRP had significantly fewer drug use days at 12 months than those who received RP, but only among individuals in therapy groups comprising one-third or more women ( p &lt; 0.0001). Specifically, all women and men who received MBRP in groups with one third or more women were abstinent from drugs at month 12, whereas those in RP groups with one third or more women had an average of about eight drug use days at month 12 (corresponding to a large between-treatment condition effect size). Conclusions: Group-based MBRP may be more efficacious than group-based RP, particularly when women compose at least one third of the therapy group. Further research is warranted on gender and group gender composition as moderators of MBRP.

Reducing dysfunctional career decision-making beliefs: Gender differences in the effectiveness of a group intervention,"Dysfunctional career decision-making beliefs can impede individuals’ ability to make career decisions. The present research focused on evaluating the effectiveness of a group intervention aimed at facilitating the transition to civilian life of 1,194 young adults before discharge from military service using multivariate multilevel analysis. The results showed gender differences in the strength of dysfunctional career decision-making beliefs, as well as in the workshop’s effectiveness in reducing them. Before the workshop men reported stronger dysfunctional beliefs than women that involved chance or fate (β = .22) and perceived gender constraints (β = .47). The workshop had a greater effect on women than on men (β = 0.16) in reducing all five types of belief, especially those involving the criticality of the decision (β = 0.20) and perceived gender constraints (β = 0.22). The effectiveness of the workshop in reducing gender-related dysfunctional beliefs varied—it was greater for participants whose gender differed from that of their group facilitator. Implications for theory, future research, and counseling are discussed.

Disclosing the diagnosis of schizophrenia: A pilot study of the ‘Coming Out Proud’ intervention,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 66(1) of International Journal of Social Psychiatry (see record 2020-03575-012). The authors regret an error regarding one of the scales used. The total score of “cognitive appraisal of stigma – Cogapp” scale was not calculated as it should, and correct results showed not to be statistically significant. Naming of the “Perceived Discrimination-Devaluation Questionnaire–PDDQ” was also modified to facilitate reader’s comprehension. The corrections are given in erratum.] Background: Schizophrenia is one of the most stigmatized psychiatric disorders, and disclosing it is often a source of stress to individuals with the disorder. The Coming Out Proud (COP) group intervention is designed to reduce the stigma’s negative impact and help participants decide if they want to disclose their disorder. Aims: To assess the effect of the COP intervention in individuals with the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Methods: A pilot study of 3 2-hour group lessons (6–12 participants) per week. Individuals were selected from three specialized outpatient services in São Paulo, Brazil; 46 people were willing to participate, 11 dropped out during the intervention and 4 were excluded due to low intelligence quotient (IQ), resulting in a final sample of 31 participants. Outcomes were assessed before ( T0 /baseline) and after ( T1 /directly) after the COP intervention, and at 3-week follow-up (T2/3 weeks after T1). We applied eight scales, of which four scales are analyzed in this article (Coming Out with Mental Illness Scale (COMIS), Cognitive Appraisal of Stigma as a Stressor (CogApp), Self-Stigma of Mental Illness Scale-Short Form (SSMIS) and Perceived Devaluation-Discrimination Questionnaire (PDDQ)). Results: People who completed the COP intervention showed a significant increase in the decision to disclose their diagnosis (22.5% in T0 vs 67.7% in T2). As to the perception of stigma as a stressor, mean values significantly increased after the intervention ( T0 = 3.83, standard deviation ( SD ) = .92 vs T2 = 4.44, SD = 1.05; p = .006). Two results had marginal significance: self-stigma was reduced ( T0 = 3.10, SD = 1.70 vs T2 = 2.73, SD = 1.87; p = .063), while perceived discrimination increased ( T0 = 2.68, SD = .55 vs T2 = 2.93, SD = .75; p = .063). Conclusion: This study suggests that the COP group intervention facilitated participants’ disclosure decisions, and the increasing awareness of stigma as a stressor in life may have facilitated their decision to eventually disclose their disorder. The results raise questions that require further analysis, taking sociocultural factors into account, as stigma is experienced differently across cultures.

EMDR group treatment of children refugees—A field study,"Given the significant growth in the migration flow of refugees who are fleeing from persecution, terrorism, and war-torn countries to Europe, there is an urgent need for effective interventions for the treatment of this highly traumatized population. EMDR Integrative Group Treatment Protocol (EMDR-IGTP) was provided to 14 child refugees (7 females) in 2016 at a Turkey orphanage near the Syrian border which was housing adult and child Syrian refugees. Treatment was provided in three groups, one each for children aged 3–7 years, pre-adolescents aged 9–12, and adolescents aged 13–18 with three sessions provided to each group. Pre-treatment assessment with multiple measures was compromised by difficulties with translator availability and refugee mobility, resulting in high attrition. When the post-treatment assessment was conducted 45 days later, many refugees had already left the orphanage. The sparse character of the data matrix produced analyzable data for 8 children (mean age 11 ± 3; 4 females) on the Children’s Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES). Statistical analysis showed a significant decrease in CRIES scores, reflecting a decrease in severity of posttraumatic symptoms.

Gestalt groups 2018 and beyond: Alternate tunings required,"Gestalt therapy and groups have enjoyed a long and prosperous relationship. It is typical for Gestalt therapists to receive the majority of their instruction, supervision, and mentorship in the “training group” and later to move into a practice, which will involve leading or consulting to a variety of types of groups. The times “they are a changing,” and demographic shifts in the United States prompt a reexamination of the theory and practice of Gestalt therapy in groups. Theoretical concepts outlined by this author in 1997 are revisited and assessed for contemporary fit. Alternate “tunings” are recommended; and also that there be ongoing attention to modifying Gestalt theory and practice, so as to be culturally sensitive to group members today and in the future.

Feasibility and acceptability of a gender-specific group treatment for men with substance use disorders,"Gender-specific group therapy for substance use disorders (SUDs) has primarily focused on women. The purpose of this study was to (a) develop a gender-specific group therapy for men with SUDs who are heterogeneous with respect to their substances of use and demographic and clinical characteristics, and (b) conduct a pilot study to assess satisfaction and feasibility. Overall, participants (N = 10) reported high satisfaction with the group. From baseline to posttreatment, there was a significant decrease in alcohol use severity and in substance use. The results of this study provide preliminary support for group therapy that focuses on gender-specific themes in an all-male setting for men with SUDs.

A group mental health randomized controlled trial for female refugees in Malaysia,"Forcibly displaced persons confront multiple stressors while awaiting permanent asylum or resettlement and often experience high levels of emotional distress. This study assessed an 8-week somatic-focused culturally adapted cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) group intervention with 39 female refugees from Afghanistan living in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Twenty-nine participants were randomly assigned to treatment conditions, resulting in 20 participants in two separate treatment groups and 9 in a waitlist control group. An additional 10 participants were not randomly assigned and therefore were treated as an additional treatment group and analyzed separately. A three-group piecewise linear growth model was specified in Mplus using Bayesian estimation. Dependent variables included emotional distress, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, and social support. From baseline to posttreatment assessments, initial intervention participants experienced significant declines in emotional distress (b = −16.90, p &lt; .001), anxiety (b = −.80, p &lt; .001), depression (b = −.59, p &lt; .001), and posttraumatic stress (b = −.24, p &lt; .05). Gains were maintained three months posttreatment, with similar trends observed among nonrandomized participants. Subsequent to receiving treatment, the waitlist control participants also showed significant declines in emotional distress (b = −20.88, p &lt; .001), anxiety (b = −1.10, p &lt; .001), depression (b = −.79, p &lt; .001), and posttraumatic stress scores (b = −.82, p &lt; .001). Comparing the treatment groups to the waitlist control group revealed large effect sizes: Cohen’s d was 2.14 for emotional distress, 2.31 for anxiety, 2.42 for depression, and 2.07 for posttraumatic stress. Relevant public health findings include low drop out, group format, and facilitation by a trained community member.

Construction and validation of the Multicultural Orientation Inventory—Group Version,"Given the continued racial/ethnic diversification of the United States, it is not uncommon for therapy groups to consist of members with diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds and various cultural identities. Scholars have underscored how this cultural diversity can directly impact many processes and outcomes of group-based interventions (Chen, Kakkad, &amp; Balzano, 2008). However, there is presently a paucity of empirical research testing the relationship between cultural processes of therapy groups and members’ outcomes. Moreover, no psychometrically sound measure of the cultural process that unfolds in group therapy currently exists. As such, this study sought to adapt the Multicultural Orientation Inventory to develop and validate the Multicultural Orientation Inventory—Group Version (MCO-G), a measure assessing the cultural humility, cultural comfort, and cultural missed opportunities in therapy groups. Data for this validation study consisted of 208 members of 49 therapy groups across 10 university counseling centers. Confirmatory factor analyses supported a 3-factor structure of the MCO-G Inventory, wherein the 3 factors corresponded with the underlying constructs of cultural humility, cultural comfort, and cultural missed opportunities. This study provides initial evidence for the estimated internal and convergent validity of the MCO-G, as measured by clients’ perceptions of a higher-order group therapeutic factor and improvement in therapy. Results provide initial support for the psychometric properties of the MCO-G. Moreover, groups’ cultural humility and cultural missed opportunities were related to members’ improvement in therapy. Clinical implications and future research are discussed.

Open wounds: Visible physical disability and its meaning for the group and society,"This article presents an exploration of the unconscious social treatment of physical disability and its transformational potential. In particular, I focus on the apparent difficulty talking about underlying emotion stimulated by disability. The social models address discrimination but obscure underlying emotion. The problem of physical disability appears to be located within an individual. I argue that this is done by mechanisms of projection and splitting and refer to the social unconscious and I suggest the problem is located within the group. I explore the process of shame and use myth of the Handless Maiden. I highlight the conductor’s role in facilitating communication and discuss self-disclosure. Personal examples and a group vignette are presented to illustrate ideas.

“Invincible Black Women”: Group therapy for Black college women,"Black college women present to counseling with an array of culturally distinct mental health concerns. There is also a subpopulation of women who may be hesitant to seek services, despite their need. These facts substantiate the necessity for culturally responsive outreach and intervention targeted at this demographic. The authors present the outreach and intervention techniques associated with “Invincible Black Women,” a culturally relevant interpersonal process group implemented with Black women attending a predominately White institution. Based on counselor experience and group member feedback, the authors offer suggestions regarding the format, topics, and facilitation style useful in promoting Black college women’s mental wellness.

Addressing the impact of racism on veterans of color: A race-based stress and trauma intervention,"Objective: Veterans of color represent a unique intersection of individuals at risk of experiencing racialized discrimination during their military service and of developing negative mental health outcomes. At the same time, there has been little guidance for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health-care providers in how to address these clinical issues in a culturally competent manner. This article describes a group-based intervention targeting race-based stress and trauma among veterans implemented at 4 different sites. Method: The authors describe the development and application of this intervention, including information about development of the group and general aims as well as the process of implementing the group across settings. Results: The authors address broad factors to consider when implementing the group, including navigating diversity dimensions within the group and addressing provider cultural competence and identity. Finally, the authors review recommendations for future directions for implementing the group within and outside of a VA setting, seeking institutional support for the group, and developing measures to assess the efficacy of the group. Conclusions: The intervention described in this article has the potential to serve as a model for development of similar interventions both within VA health-care centers and non-VA health-care settings.

Freeing Chinese abused women from stereotype: A pretest-posttest comparison study on group intervention in refuge centers,"Objective: The efficacy of heal-change group (HCG) intervention—brief trauma-recovery group intervention applying a gender-specific cognitive behavioral approach—for Chinese-abused women in refuge centers was examined in a pretest-posttest comparison study. Methods: A total of 100 women at three refuge centers in Hong Kong participated. Among them, 50 women from two centers joined the HCG and 50 women from the remaining center participated in a comparison mutual support group. Participants and interviewers were blinded to the group assignment. Both groups were six sessions long. Linear regression analyses were performed using the intention-to-treat framework. Results: Significant improvements in PTSD symptoms (overall mean change of −1.6, p &lt; .001; subdomain scores; p &lt; .001 to &lt; .01) and depressive symptoms (BDI-II mean change; p &lt; .01) were recorded in the intervention group. Conclusion: The results suggest HCG is beneficial to Chinese-abused women. Further research is needed to determine the intervention’s effectiveness in improving longer-term outcomes in these women.

Effectiveness of a trauma‐focused group intervention for young refugees: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: As access to evidence-based treatments for young refugees with posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) is limited, we developed the trauma-focused group intervention Mein Weg to be delivered by trained social workers. A recently published pilot study delivered preliminary evidence of the intervention with regard to symptom reduction and its feasibility. The aim of this study was, therefore, to determine whether the intervention, in addition to usual care (UC), is more effective in reducing PTSS (primary outcome) compared to UC alone. Methods: A parallel group randomized controlled trial was conducted in seven German child and adolescent welfare agencies. Participants were randomly assigned to either six sessions Mein Weg ( n = 50; M age = 17.00, 94% male) or UC ( n = 49; M age = 16.92, 92% male). Mixed effect models, with fixed effects of group and time as well as their interaction, were performed on the relevant outcome measures. This trial was registered in the German Clinical Trials Registry (#DRKS00010915, https://www.d rks.de/drks_web/). Results: Intention-to-treat analyses showed that Mein Weg was significantly superior to UC regarding symptom improvement of self-reported PTSS ( Mein Weg: d = .61, UC: d = .15) and depression ( Mein Weg: d = .63, UC: d = .06), but not regarding caregiver-reported symptoms and self-reported dysfunctional posttraumatic cognitions. Conclusions: Mein Weg is effective for young refugees according to self-reports and can be viewed as a valuable component in a stepped care approach for this vulnerable population. The findings need to be replicated with independent clinical assessments.

Psychotherapeutic group intervention for traumatized male refugees using imaginative stabilization techniques—A pilot study in a German reception center,"Background: Due to persecution, human rights violations and armed conflicts, the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is high in refugee populations. Previous studies indicate that trauma-focused treatments are highly effective in treating PTSD in refugees. However, these approaches rely on the stability of the therapeutic setting, treatment continuity, and safe housing. Although early treatment of PTSD is recommended, these requirements are not met in reception centers. Therefore, we conducted a pilot study to examine the effect of imaginative stabilization techniques derived from psychodynamic psychotraumatology therapy for the early stabilization of traumatized refugees in a reception center. Methods: From May 2017 to April 2018, 86 imaginative stabilization group therapy sessions have taken place. A sample of 43 out of 46 traumatized refugees completed self-report questionnaires assessing PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms prior to attending open imaginative stabilization group therapy sessions. Furthermore, participants filled in self-report questionnaires on distress and emotional state (valence/arousal/dominance) before and after each session. After having participated in four consecutive sessions, a sub-group of 17 participants completed a follow-up assessment of PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 25 participants 2 weeks after their last session attendance to explore self-practice habits post intervention. Results: The pre-post-intervention comparison of scores indicated a significant reduction of distress ( z = −3.35, p &lt; 0.001, r = −0.51) and an improvement of affective reports for valence ( z = −4.79, p &lt; 0.001, r = −0.82) and dominance ( z = −3.89, p &lt; 0.001, r = −0.59), whereas arousal scores were not affected. We found a significant reduction of anxiety symptoms ( z = −2.04, p &lt; 0.05, r = −0.49), whereas PTSD and depression scores remained unchanged. Follow-up interviews revealed that 80% of the participants continued to practice the imaginative stabilization techniques after redistribution to other accommodation. Conclusion: The results indicate that imaginative stabilization techniques are a promising and feasible approach to treat refugees in unstable reception center settings. In regular imaginative stabilization group therapy sessions, we were able to reduce the participants' distress and anxiety symptoms while strengthening their internal resources and increasing their emotional stability.

Neuroscience and racism: The power of groups for overcoming implicit bias,"Recent developments in brain imaging have enhanced our understanding of how individuals respond to racial cues and stereotypes. Evidence suggests that racial stereotypes are more emotional in nature than other phenotypic stereotypes. One challenging emotion that may be evoked is shame. The experience of shame may impede self-reflection, interfere with one’s awareness of potential implicit racial biases, and impede the exploration of racial considerations. The group therapy setting provides a rich context for addressing racial bias as well as the emotions and challenging interactions that often accompany it. Practical techniques are presented for managing shame along with other emotions that may emerge in discussing race or addressing racial dynamics in groups.

Differences that make a difference: Diversity and the process group leader,"Traditional group therapy often does not directly address how group leaders can work with oppression and marginalization that occurs between group members. Many group psychotherapists believe that attention to social justice concerns is not within their roles as group leaders and, consequently, may not address issues of member oppression and marginalization. Conflict emerging out of cultural differences can have far-reaching consequences if not accurately identified and effectively managed by group leaders. The purpose of this article is to provide an understanding of factors that contribute to group leaders fostering a climate that facilitates an exploration of cultural issues, along with clinical examples illustrating diversity-related issues that may arise.

Racial-cultural events in group therapy as perceived by group therapists,"This qualitative study explored the nature of the retrospective experiences of helpful and difficult racial-cultural events in group therapy as perceived by eight White group therapists and six group therapists of color who had a minimum of 5 years of experience working in a variety of group therapy settings. Racial-cultural events are incidents, interactions, or processes in a therapy group that are interpreted as related to or influenced by visible racial dimensions, and any stereotypes and assumptions pertaining to those dimensions. Participants completed demographic questionnaires and in-depth, semistructured telephone interviews. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed, and then the transcriptions were analyzed using grounded theory, resulting in three main emergent themes: (a) helpful events, (b) mixed events, and (c) hindering events. Study findings provide insight into effective group therapy with multicultural populations and offer directions for future research.

An Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) group intervention for Syrian refugees with post-traumatic stress symptoms: Results of a randomized controlled trial,"The number of refugees has increased significantly over the past few years. PTSD and depression are among the most common mental health problems among refugees. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), an effective treatment for PTSD, is usually administered individually. The availability of mental health resources would be greatly enhanced when EMDR can be delivered to groups. The EMDR G-TEP is a group protocol based on Early EMDR intervention protocols. There is clinical evidence and one field study published on the effect of EMDR G-TEP and there is only one RCT published on the treatment of PTSD and depression in a refugee camp. The aim of our study was to investigate the efficacy of EMDR G-TEP in treating post-trauma symptoms and depression and preventing the development of chronic PTSD among refugees living in a refugee camp. 47 adult participants with PTSD symptoms were randomly allocated to experimental ( n = 18) and control ( n = 29) groups. We measured Impact of Event Scale (IES-R), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) at pre-, post- and 4-week follow-up. Analysis of the results showed that the EMDR G-TEP group had significantly lower PTSD and depression symptoms after intervention. The percentage of PTSD diagnosis decreased from 100 to 38.9% in the EMDR G-TEP group and was unchanged in the control group. Following the EMDR G-TEP intervention 61.1% of the experimental group no longer had a PTSD diagnosis; this decrease was maintained at 4 weeks follow-up. In the control group the percentage of people who no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD was 10.3% post-test and 6.9% at 4 weeks follow-up. A significant decrease in depression symptoms from pre-test levels was found in EMDR group but not in the control group follow up-test. This study indicated that EMDR G-TEP effectively reduced PTSD symptoms among refugees living in a camp, after two treatment sessions conducted over a period of 3 days. Further studies need to be performed using a larger number of participants, followed for a longer period of time and given more treatment sessions to strengthen our findings.

Race/ethnicity and racial group composition moderate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based relapse prevention for substance use disorder,"Introduction: Mindfulness-based relapse prevention has shown promise as a treatment for substance use disorder but its efficacy according to racial/ethnic minority status and group composition is unknown. Method: This is a secondary analysis of existing data (Bowen et al., 2014) testing individual race/ethnicity and racial/ethnic group composition as moderators of mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP). Participants ( N = 191; 29% female; 47% racial/ethnic minority; mean age = 39) with substance use disorder were randomized to MBRP or relapse prevention (RP). Outcomes were heavy drinking days (HDD) and drug use days (DUD) 12 months after treatment completion. Negative binominal regression models were conducted. Results: Analyses accounted for drug of choice. Individual race/ethnicity was a significant moderator of substance use outcomes. White participants had lower HDD in MBRP than RP (IRR = 0, 95% CI: 0,0), whereas for minority participants, there was no treatment difference in HDD. Conversely, minorities had lower DUD in MBRP than RP (IRR = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.10), whereas for whites there was no treatment difference in DUD. Group racial/ethnic composition was a significant moderator. Participants in groups with more than half whites had lower HDD in MBRP than RP (IRR = 0.01, 95% CI: 0, 0.09), whereas for participants in groups with more than half minorities there was no treatment difference in HDD. Exploratory analyses suggested MBRP resulted in better outcomes than RP when individual race/ethnic status was reflected in the group race/ethnicity (i.e., whites in groups with more than half whites or minorities in groups with more than half minorities). Conclusions: Among whites, MBRP appears to be more effective than RP in preventing heavy drinking relapse. However, among racial/ethnic minorities, MBRP appears to more effective than RP in preventing drug use relapse. This suggests that the interaction between individual race/ethnicity and group composition may influence primary outcomes.

Challenge: To be &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. A group intervention program to promote the positive development of adolescents,"In the last decades, research has focused on the promotion of positive youth development by creating, implementing and assessing positive youth interventions programs. This study analyzes the effectiveness of a group intervention program, titled “Challenge: To Be + ”, aimed to promote positive development of adolescents, focusing on positive emotions, character strengths, and optimal experiences. We assessed its impact on positive developmental dimensions (self-esteem, self-concept, psychological well-being and satisfaction with life) and tested gender as a predictor of program impact in the experimental group. Furthermore, we explored the perceptions and the evaluation of adolescents regarding the program and its contents, using quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Participated 99 adolescents (55 girls and 44 boys) from the ninth grade, divided into experimental (n = 74) and comparison (n = 25) groups. Results showed higher levels of self-esteem and satisfaction with life at posttest in the experimental group when compared to the comparison group, after controlling for the pretest. Taking in consideration the experimental group, gender was a predictor of program improvement on positive developmental dimensions, indicating a stronger effect on girls. Qualitative and quantitative results showed a positive appraisal of the program, with no gender differences in this appreciation. Findings support the importance of this program for the promotion of positive youth development.

No man left behind: Effectively engaging male military veterans in counseling,"Ex-military men have emerged as a vulnerable subgroup for mental illness amid long-standing trends signaling men’s reticence to seek professional help. Less explored is how men engage or disengage when they actually do enter helping programs. Contrasting decades of quantitative research pairing masculine ideology with low help seeking (i.e., describing the problem), this article draws on qualitative data to distill factors that help men become engaged and committed to counseling (i.e., identifying solutions). Shared is an evaluation of a treatment program with high success rates and virtually no dropouts—a unique occurrence in men’s counseling. Enhanced Critical Incident Technique data suggest that helping men feel competent and free from judgment in the company of down-to-earth peers and genuine practitioners are instrumental in helping men draw benefit from counseling. While appealing to male gender roles may be critical in recruiting men to counseling, men can transition to embrace virtues (i.e., that might be shared by men and women alike) and universal human needs as counseling progresses.

Extending the multicultural orientation (MCO) framework to group psychotherapy: A clinical illustration,"Multicultural group work has received growing attention over the past two decades; however, there is a lack of conceptual frameworks to guide therapists’ cultural processes within group therapy at present. As such, we extend the multicultural orientation (MCO) to group therapy in an effort to provide a conceptual framework for group therapists to effectively engage multicultural group work. The MCO framework was developed in an effort to operationalize therapists’ cultural processes of cultural humility, cultural comfort, and cultural opportunity. Although the MCO framework has been empirically tested within an individual psychotherapy context, application to alternative therapeutic modalities is needed. Given the inherent multicultural nature of group therapy and calls for group therapist to be culturally competent in the delivery of group-based services, we extend the MCO framework to the practice of group therapy. In this article, we provide a rationale for the application of the MCO framework to the practice of group therapy, and illustrate how group therapists’ cultural humility, comfort, and opportunities can assist in establishing a multicultural group orientation throughout the development of the group.

The feasibility of a culturally informed group therapy for patients with schizophrenia and their family members,"Research suggests that group-based psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia provide benefits to patients and family members alike. However, few existing treatments consider cultural factors that may enhance their efficacy with diverse populations. The current study examined the feasibility of a culturally informed group therapy for schizophrenia (CIGT-S), which incorporates collectivistic principles and spiritual coping into the treatment protocol. The feasibility of the group protocol was tested by examining differences in patient symptom severity and patient and family member depression, anxiety, and stress after completion of the group program. Within-groups analyses were conducted comparing baseline data to group termination data from 12 patients and 11 family members. Additionally, between-groups analyses were conducted comparing waitlist termination data from 20 patients and 13 family members to group termination data from 12 patients and 11 family members. Finally, we examined participant satisfaction with the group protocol, including qualitative reports on components of the protocol that participants deemed most valuable. Results indicated that patients demonstrated lower levels of symptom severity upon completion of the CIGT-S program; however, no other significant effects were found. Results examining overall patient and family member satisfaction with the treatment protocol indicated that patients and family members both reported being highly satisfied by the treatment program. This was also represented in participant’s open-ended responses to our satisfaction questionnaire. These findings indicate that CIGT-S may represent a feasible, cost-effective approach that can be flexibly used with patients and family members of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds.

Forio: A Swiss treatment program for young sex offenders with intellectual disabilities,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a description of a Swiss outpatient group therapy for adolescent and young men with intellectual disabilities who have sexually offended. Design/methodology/approach: The findings from two studies that examined the treatment independently from one another are brought together. These combine the qualitative methods of document analysis of programme tools, overt participant observations of treatment sessions and semi-structured interviews with programme designers. Findings: At the heart of Forio treatment is a seven-step programme that aims to enable participants to increase their risk management capacities and foster pro-social behaviours. Responsivity issues are a key consideration, and the use of a traffic light system to distinguish acceptable, borderline and unacceptable behaviours provides a central reference point throughout treatment and beyond. Treatment relies on individuals practising newly learned pro-social behaviours in their daily life. To facilitate this, risks are managed, and support is provided via close networking between therapists and the supervision and social care network. Practical implications: This paper offers detailed descriptions of the programme setting, structure and tools, which will allow international readers to adapt the techniques discussed to suit their specific treatment context. Particularly, the close networking between treatment providers and those managing risks in the community is commendable. Originality/value: The Forio programme has not previously been described in English language papers. Even though it arises from the same evidence base as the internationally more widely known programmes, this paper offers unique insights into ways in which known concepts have been adapted to suit local circumstances.

How do men with severe sexual and physical childhood traumatization experience trauma-stabilizing group treatment? A qualitative study,"Background: Exposure to potentially traumatizing events, defined as events involving actual or threatened death or serious injury, is associated with an elevated risk of developing enduring physical, psychological and social problems. Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that can occur after prolonged and repeated trauma. At least 30% of the sexually abused population is male, but in spite of this fact, treatment research focusing on male victims is virtually non-existent in comparison to research on female victims. Objective: Trauma-stabilizing group treatment is an increasingly used treatment method for patients with complex PTSD. The aim of the present study was to explore how men participating in a gender-specific trauma-stabilizing intervention experience this treatment approach. Methods: Five men who participated in a trauma-stabilizing group treatment were interviewed with a semi-structured qualitative interview. The data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: The analysis revealed five main themes. The themes highlight the experiences of the participants and describe positive and negative experiences: (1) Group atmosphere, comprising safety, community, emotional openness, anxiety and pressure; (2) Learning, categorized into knowledge and self-understanding; (3) Motivation, which describes both inner and outer motivation; (4) Structure, comprising structure of the meetings, group size and duration of the meetings; and (5) Gender, defined as the experiences of being in an all-male group with female group leaders. Conclusions: There seem to be a lot of advantages to inviting men to attend gender-specific groups for trauma-stabilizing treatment. The men emphasized the support they received and that participating in a mixed-gender group would have been more difficult. In the future, it may be important to arrange all-male stabilization groups with more focus on male-specific topics.

Family caregiver support groups: Spiritual reflections’ impact on stress management,"Objectives: Caregiving for people with neurodegenerative disease (e.g. Alzheimer's disease (AD); frontotemporal dementia (FTD)) is provided primarily by the family care system. Caregiving is taxing and much of the caregiving research is guided by a stress/adaptation theoretical perspective. Within this theoretical model, the role of spirituality in rendering meaning to the caregiver role remains unexplored. We conducted a qualitative analysis of expressions of spirituality and its meaningfulness during the caregiving journey within the context of an online video conferencing support group intervention program. Methods: Eighteen AD and six FTD caregivers participated in the Caring for Others evidence-based program consisting of 10 weekly virtual online support group sessions facilitated by experienced gerontological social workers. Results: Content analysis of the video-recorded group interactions yielded recurrent themes of caregivers’ spiritual reflections and their associations with managing caregiver stress responses. Conclusion: The findings inform professional observations of the importance of spiritual beliefs in understanding how caregivers ascribe both positive and negative meanings to critical life events and their management.

Evaluation of a trauma‐focused group intervention for unaccompanied young refugees: A pilot study,"Recent research has shown that unaccompanied young refugees (UYR) encounter a wide range of traumatic events during preflight, flight, and resettlement. Although many UYR are resourceful, many develop posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, only a small number of vulnerable UYR have access to trauma‐focused interventions. Trauma‐focused group interventions, adapted to the needs of UYR, may be one way of improving their mental health. A total of 29 male UYR between 14 and 18 years of age, mainly from Afghanistan, participated in the evaluation study of a trauma‐focused group intervention entitled Mein Weg (My Way). The intervention included six sessions of psychoeducation, relaxation, trauma narrative, and cognitive restructuring. Pre–post comparisons of PTSS assessed by the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen (CATS) were used. At study entry, participants endorsed, on average, eight traumatic events. After the group intervention, the participants reported significantly fewer overall PTSS preintervention mean = 27.6, SD = 7.9; postintervention mean = 20.7, SD = 6.3; t (28) = 4.2, p = .001, Cohen's d = 0.97. Improvement was especially pronounced in the domains of reexperiencing and avoidance, as well as negative alterations in cognitions and mood. There were 14 participants preintervention and 7 postintervention who fulfilled the PTSD criteria. This pilot study presented initial evidence of the efficacy of the trauma‐focused group intervention with regard to PTSS reduction.

Establishing a secure base to increase exploration of diversity in groups,"All groups can be considered multicultural, and group members often present with issues that stem from contextual factors related to cultural identities, including experiences with oppression. Therefore, group leaders must be able to effectively facilitate deep intercultural dialogues in psychotherapy groups, and we suggest that an understanding of attachment theory can help leaders engage group members in these dialogues. In order to demonstrate how attachment theory can be applied to the exploration of diversity in groups, we provide a case example from an intergroup dialogue group bringing together religious minorities, secular individuals, and Christians over the course of eight weeks. In this example, we focus on the two group members who scored the lowest (Jill) and highest (Sarah) on a measure of attachment anxiety and avoidance to illustrate the experiences of one member with more secure attachment and one with more preoccupied attachment. Specifically, we present data from their weekly reflective journals to explore their different experiences of the group over time. Finally, we discuss the case in terms of attachment theory and highlight implications for group leaders.

Group psychotherapy with transgender and gender nonconforming adults: Evidence-based practice applications,"Although there are descriptions of transgender-affirmative group psychotherapy services in the literature, there is limited research on the topic. Mental health professionals who plan to offer such services should draw on evidence-based treatments, where appropriate, and have a working knowledge of current standards of care, practice guidelines, and counseling competencies. This article reviews and synthesizes the existing research and scholarship on this topic, placing an emphasis on group-specific competencies and intervention components that can be integrated into psychotherapy groups for transgender and gender nonconforming clients.

"Examining the relationship between group member gender, gender composition, and outcomes of weight management therapy groups","Presently there is a lack of evidence regarding the impact of gender composition of mixed-gender weight management therapy groups on members’ posttreatment outcomes. As such, the current study tested the association between the gender composition of mixed-gender narrative therapy groups for weight management and members’ posttreatment outcomes. Specifically, we examined the variability in group members’ adjusted posttreatment psychological (Outcome Questionnaire-45 [OQ-45]) and obesity-related (Obesity Related Well-Being [ORWELL 97]) symptoms as a function of the quadratic proportion of female members in a group, and the interaction between group member gender and the quadratic proportion of female group members. Pre- and posttreatment OQ-45 and ORWELL 97 data was collected from 32 men and 67 women participating in 15 short-term weight-management therapy groups. Results indicated that the quadratic proportion of female group members was significantly related to adjusted posttreatment OQ-45 scores, such that group members reported fewer psychological symptoms at posttreatment in more proportionally balanced groups of men and women. This relationship was not significant for adjusted posttreatment ORWELL 97 scores. Additionally, in an exploratory analysis we found a significant interaction between group member gender, the proportion of female group members, and group members’ adjusted posttreatment OQ-45 scores, indicating that the relationship between gender composition and adjusted posttreatment OQ-45 scores was stronger for men than women. These preliminary findings suggest that the gender composition of weight management groups is an important factor in group members’ posttreatment psychological outcomes.

Developing a psychotropic medication education group on a secure ward for men with intellectual disabilities,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to establish and evaluate a psychotropic medication education group for men with intellectual disability on a secure psychiatric ward. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-disciplinary team was convened to oversee the project. A curriculum was developed that covered major classes of psychotropic drugs as well as broader themes related to taking medication and general wellbeing. Each group session incorporated a range of teaching methods supported by accessible materials. Evaluation was by qualitative and quantitative methods. Findings: There was interest and enthusiasm for the group. Participant feedback was generally positive and most of those who completed the group reported achieving their personal learning goals. There was no significant difference in results of a medication knowledge test at baseline and at the end of the course. Feedback from group members and reflections of the course facilitators are discussed. Research limitations/implications: The results of this small-scale study may not be applicable to other groups or settings. Evaluation measures seemed unable to capture some elements of the group processes and outcomes. Practical implications: Establishing and running a psychoeducational group on a low-secure ward for men with intellectual disabilities is possible and potentially valuable. Learning from this project will be useful for others considering group-based interventions for people with intellectual disability. Originality/value: This paper adds to the limited literature describing interventions to improve medication knowledge in people with intellectual disability.

Supporting decision-making by a health promotion programme: Experiences of persons ageing in the context of migration,"This study is part of the Promoting Aging Migrants’ Capabilities programme that applied person-centred group meetings and one individual home visit to prolong independence in daily activities among people ≥ 70 years who had migrated to Sweden from Finland or the Western Balkan region. With the purpose to understand programme outcomes, the study aimed to explore the participants’ everyday experiences of using health-promoting messages exchanged during the programme. Using a grounded theory approach, 12 persons aged 70–83 years were interviewed six months to one year after their participation in the programme. The participants experienced how using health-promoting messages was a dynamic process of how to make decisions on taking action to satisfy health-related needs of oneself or others immediately or deferring action. Five sub-processes were also identified: gaining inner strength, meeting challenges in available resources, being attentive to what is worth knowing, approaching health risks, and identifying opportunities to advocate for others . The results suggest that the programme could develop personal skills to support older people who have migrated to overcome health-related challenges. They further demonstrate the importance of supporting their health literacy before personal resources hinder action, and call for research on programmes to overcome environmental barriers to health.

"Delivering the treatment so that the therapy occurs: Enhancing the effectiveness of time-limited, manualized group treatments","Group therapy has been shown to be effective for treating a variety of problems, across particular treatment approaches. However, interesting questions about how group therapy helps people persist, given that little variance in client outcomes has been found to be attributable to the particular brand of therapy or treatment protocol. At the same time, treatments that are both empirically supported and efficient are in demand. Therefore, the present article reviews research related to transtheoretical constructs that can be applied to enhance the effectiveness of any short-term, manualized group therapy treatment. Specifically, research related to group therapy effectiveness, common or therapeutic factors models, group stage development theory, key interpersonal processes, and constructs from the multicultural competency literature are reviewed. Examples of how these principles might be applied in practice to a specific therapy group are also provided.

Current and future challenges in group therapy,"This article reviews changes and considers challenges in group therapy since AGPA’s 50 th anniversary 25 years ago. The authors acknowledge the many important changes that have occurred in research, theory, and practice in the last two and a half decades, but focus on four topics: treating trauma with cultural sensitivity; the impact of technology on groups; challenges for LGBTQ clients in group; and the future for psychodynamic groups. The authors review the literature and provide recommendations on how to address the challenges.

To a classroom in Botswana (and back) in search of cultural understanding,"This article highlights on to a classroom in Botswana (and back) in search of cultural understanding. Author experiences of teaching group counseling in a setting very different from her own allowed her to have her cultural assumptions violated in beneficial ways. Professionally, she was successful in at least beginning her quest to learn more about the culture of Botswana and generating potential answers to her questions about how to adapt Western group counseling to this context. At the same time, she went through a personal process of losing her footing and feeling frozen out of concern for being culturally sensitive, and then working her way back to a new equilibrium through her relationships and interactions with students. This process, which was more difficult than she had anticipated, has had an ongoing impact on her teaching back in the United States. Within the classroom, she now seek to provide activities and other opportunities for previously hidden aspects of students’ own culture and its impact on them to be revealed and experienced. Her journey to Botswana and back has convinced her that allowing students to experience some sense of disequilibrium and then facilitating multiple reflection and processing opportunities for them to put the pieces back together again in a new way is essential to developing cultural understanding among people and groups.

Film and culture: Art works,"As a clinician, Abbott's original psychotherapy training was in group analysis with a strong emphasis on intercultural perspectives. Abbott discusses memories of conducting a particular therapy group in central London, which was composed of patients drawn from widely diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Only one or two members of this long-term therapy group had English as their mother tongue. From time to time the narratives, images and metaphors of popular films and contemporary culture would take hold of the group as we struggled to find a common language. When ordinary conversation floundered, collective and individual experiences of the arts seemed to facilitate communication with one another. As cohesion developed through mutual immersion in the discussion of a film, this was used as a means to develop an increasingly coherent discourse as a group. Where language is both limited and limiting, art works.

Intricate interplays in women's groups: Vulnerability and strength meet in the second half of life,"This article describes an approach used with therapeutic groups for women at midlife and beyond (aged 45 to 70 years). The method integrates feminist-relational and narrative concepts and its application was associated with significant movement between vulnerability and strength. Uses of writing and witnessing enabled participants to challenge themselves and others within a supportive context. A balance between inner work and mutuality, spontaneity and structure, contributed to the weaving of a relational tapestry in the group setting.

Tailoring social competence interventions for children with learning disabilities,"Challenges in social competence are common in children with Learning Disabilities (LDs), particularly those who present with co-occurring mental health challenges (LD + MH). Social competence calls upon a complex set of skills, including social skills, perspective-taking abilities, and an understanding of the social environment. Successful enactment of these skills necessitates behavioral and emotion regulation, an area of weakness for many youth with LD + MH. Using a mixed-method design, the present study assessed the efficacy of a social competence group program for children with LD + MH (mean age = 11.4 years) in which group size, content, and structure are tailored to the child’s level of emotion regulation, information processing abilities, and social competence goals. Quantitative measures completed by parents and coded behavioral observations completed pre- and post-treatment indicated significant gains in initiation and engagement in positive social interactions, foundational skills that support improvement in social competence. Qualitative interviews with parents, children and teachers suggested improvements in social self-concept, initiation, and emotion regulation. Tailoring treatment to the child’s information processing and emotion regulation abilities, as well as ‘in the moment’ feedback, supported gains made and contributed to participants having a positive social experience. Directions for future research are discussed.

"Understanding the ""black box"" of a health-promotion program: Keys to enable health among older persons aging in the context of migration","Although the need to make health services more accessible to persons who have migrated has been identified, knowledge about health-promotion programs (HPPs) from the perspective of older persons born abroad is lacking. This study explores the design experiences and content implemented in an adapted version of a group-based HPP developed in a researcher-community partnership. Fourteen persons aged 70-83 years or older who had migrated to Sweden from Finland or the Balkan Peninsula were included. A grounded theory approach guided the data collection and analysis. The findings showed how participants and personnel jointly helped raise awareness. The participants experienced three key processes that could open doors to awareness: enabling community, providing opportunities to understand and be understood, and confirming human values and abilities. Depending on how the HPP content and design are being shaped by the group, the key processes could both inhibit or encourage opening doors to awareness. Therefore, this study provides key insights into how to enable health by deepening the understanding of how the exchange of health-promoting messages is experienced to be facilitated or hindered. This study adds to the scientific knowledge base of how the design and content of HPP may support and recognize the capabilities of persons aging in the context of migration.

Expanding research on a brief exposure-based group treatment with incarcerated women,"Incarcerated women experience high rates of sexual victimization and mental illness. The current study evaluated outcomes from an eight-session exposure-based group treatment with incarcerated women who had experienced sexual victimization. A total of 52 women participated in nine separate groups over a 2-year period. Participants reported statistically significant reductions in posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and generalized anxiety disorder symptoms from pretreatment to posttreatment (large effect sizes; all η2 &gt; .20). Among participants with pretreatment and posttreatment data (n² = 36), approximately 70% showed clinical significant reductions and/or were considered recovered (e.g., no longer above the clinical cutoff) on at least one of the three diagnostic measures.

Transcending traditional group work: Using the Brazilian martial art of Capoeira as a clinical therapeutic group for culturally diverse adolescents,"Many culturally diverse populations, such as angry youth, relapse into aggressive behaviors because of poor behavioral self-efficacy and socialization skills. To supplement traditional treatments, there is need for culturally sensitive and effective programs. Martial arts, when integrated with culturally sensitive clinical components, are a viable addendum to therapy. Martial arts represent a paradigm shift from talk therapies to more interactive, socially involving group methods. Combining the movement of martial arts with culturally sensitive therapeutic principles can make a significant difference with culturally diverse populations. Capoeira (a Brazilian martial art) is a potential multicultural group approach for behavioral change.

The effect of positive group psychotherapy on self-esteem and state anger among adolescents at Korean immigrant churches,"The aim of the current study was to describe participants' experiences and examine the effects of group therapy on self-esteem and state anger among the adolescent children of immigrants in the US. A quasi-experimental design and qualitative and quantitative methods were used. Group therapy was conducted for 8 weeks. Thirty-three adolescents took part in the study. Quantitative results revealed that group therapy improved self-esteem (t = 2.222. p &lt;.05) but not state anger. However, qualitative results suggested that group therapy helped improve interpersonal relationships and communication skills, the forgiveness of others, and the management of anger. Furthermore, group therapy utilizing positive psychology strategies improved self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, and communication skills.

Inpatient group therapeutic interventions for patients with intellectual disabilities,"Group therapy can be an effective mode of therapy, used on an inpatient unit, as it can allow patients to become allies in their journey to understand and overcome their mental health needs. The therapeutic principles discussed by Dr Irvin Yalom illustrate the significance and importance of group therapy, which was strongly incorporated into interactive behavior therapy (IBT) developed by Dr Daniel J Tomasulo. IBT is a type of group therapy, more action oriented, created to allow patients with intellectual disabilities (IDs) to better comprehend discussed topics, by designing and tailoring activities to meet their cognitive and linguistic capabilities. Additional details found in this article will illustrate the methods by which IBT is capable of meeting the needs of patients with ID. Such adjustments include shorter duration of activities to maximize concentration, proactive role-playing involving the synergistic effort of all members of the group, and limiting the authoritative role of the therapist in a group environment (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",1984309753, 2017-02623-005,Scholarly Journals,"Reddy, Vilash",,," © 2014, The Author(s)", 2014-10-15,,, 10.1177/1744629514559314," Journal , Peer Reviewed Journal , Journal Article", 1744-6309,, Mar 2015,,,1744-6295,1, English, English, 51-57,Mar 2015,Journal of Intellectual Disabilities," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2015, US, PsycINFO © Publisher specific,19,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1984309753?accountid=14766," 3250 Developmental Disorders & Autism , 3300 Health & Mental Health Treatment & Prevention"," 3250 Developmental Disorders & Autism , 3300 Health & Mental Health Treatment & Prevention"," 3250 Developmental Disorders & Autism , 3300 Health & Mental Health Treatment & Prevention", Electronic, 51," 3250 Developmental Disorders & Autism , 3300 Health & Mental Health Treatment & Prevention"," Group Psychotherapy

Critical issues in international group counseling,"Three-quarters of the world come from collectivistic group-oriented cultures. As the world becomes more globalized it is inevitable that group counseling will be a major choice of healing and psychological intervention internationally. However, a review of scholarly articles from The Journal for Specialists in Group Work and Group Dynamics during the past 10 years reveals that there are few articles that address international group work. To better prepare group counselors to do group counseling across international boundaries this article discusses 9 critical cross-cultural themes in international group work and the importance of having an international group counseling training curriculum.

Effectiveness of Group Theraplay® on enhancing social skills among children with developmental disabilities,"Theraplay® is a play therapy approach that helps children form better relationships and attachments with others. It focuses on the nonverbal aspects of interaction. This study reports on a Group Theraplay program in a special school for children with developmental disabilities. Twenty-three students, arranged into four groups, participated in the year-long program that used Theraplay principles to enhance their social development. Results were compared with a group of 15 students who served as the comparison control. Data from the Social Responsiveness Scale showed that students from the Theraplay group had significant improvement in the subscale of “social communication” when compared with the comparison group. Feedback from teachers suggested new ideas in working with this group of children. A discussion of the rationale behind why Theraplay works for these children was presented. The limitations of this study and directions for future research are addressed.

Group therapy for women with substance use disorders: Results from the Women’s Recovery Group Study,"Background: This Stage II trial builds on a Stage I trial comparing the single-gender Women's Recovery Group (WRG) to mixed-gender Group Drug Counseling (GDC) that demonstrated preliminary support for the WRG in treating women with substance use disorders. The Stage II trial aims were to (1) investigate effectiveness of the WRG relative to GDC in a sample of women heterogeneous with respect to substance of abuse and co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and (2) demonstrate the feasibility of implementing WRG in an open-enrollment group format at two sites. Method: In this randomized clinical trial, participants were included if they were substance dependent and had used substances within the past 60 days ( n = 158). Women were randomized to WRG ( n = 52) or GDC ( n = 48); men were assigned to GDC ( n = 58). Substance use outcomes were assessed at months 1–6 and 9. Results: Women in both the WRG and GDC had reductions in mean number of substance use days during treatment (12.7 vs 13.7 day reductions for WRG and GDC, respectively) and 6 months post-treatment (10.3 vs 12.7 day reductions); however, there were no significant differences between groups. Conclusions: The WRG demonstrated comparable effectiveness to standard mixed-gender treatment (i.e., GDC) and is feasibly delivered in an open-group format typical of community treatment. It provides a manual-based group therapy with women-focused content that can be implemented in a variety of clinical settings for women who are heterogeneous with respect to their substance of abuse, other co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and life-stage.

The HEALTHY group: A mind–body–spirit approach for treating anxiety and depression in youth,"Anxiety and depression are complex mental health concerns affecting adolescents, and when experienced together the prognosis can be worsened. Current evidence based approaches used in social work interventions include cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical therapy, and counselling incorporating psychotherapy and psychoeducation, however they do not work for all individuals and they are not holistic. This paper argues that spirituality is a missing element of current social work interventions for treating anxiety and depression. Yoga has emerged as one type of mind body spirit intervention that is more holistic in nature, and it is deemed to be a positive approach that can be included in social work interventions. Furthermore, the explicit incorporation of spirituality is seen as a necessary component of treatment. Literature pertaining to spirituality as an important dimension of life, mental health, coping and wellbeing provides a rationale for its inclusion into comprehensive multi-modal approaches. The HEALTHY group is highlighted as a comprehensive multi-modal mind body spirit approach that addresses the gap of explicitly attending to spirituality. Implications for practice are put forth regarding the need for research on this kind of comprehensive integrative mind body and spirit social work intervention on the outcomes for adolescents experiencing anxiety and depression.

Client perspectives about religion and spirituality in group counseling,"The main purpose of this study was to examine client-rated appropriateness and preferences regarding the discussion of religious and spiritual concerns in group counseling. Participants were 164 group clients at nine university counseling centers nationwide. Clients volunteered to complete an online questionnaire about their experiences and opinions regarding religion and spirituality in group counseling. The majority of clients indicated that religious concerns are an appropriate topic for group counseling and reported a preference to discuss religious and spiritual concerns with their groups. Regression analyses examined predictors of client-rated (a) appropriateness of discussing religious concerns in group, (b) appropriateness of group leaders using religious or spiritual interventions, and (c) preferences for discussing religious and spiritual issues in group. The most consistent predictors of these ratings were client spirituality, client religious commitment, degree of spiritual struggles, and the frequency with which religion had already been discussed in the clients’ specific groups.

A brief anti-stigma intervention for Chinese immigrant caregivers of individuals with psychosis: Adaptation and initial findings,"Mental illness stigma has adverse effects on both the caregivers' psychological well-being and the effectiveness of care that consumers receive. While anti-stigma interventions for family caregivers from Western settings have recently shown efficacy, these interventions may not be equally applicable across culturally diverse groups. Specifically, Chinese immigrant caregivers experience heightened internalized stigma, which predisposes the adoption of harmful coping strategies and reduced quality of social networks. We present an anti-stigma intervention based on a peer-family group format, co-led by a clinician and a trained family caregiver, to counter stigma among Chinese immigrants. Data are presented from a brief intervention administered to a pilot sample of 11 Chinese immigrant caregivers that provides: psychoeducation, strategies to counter experienced discrimination, and techniques to resist internalized stigma. Case vignettes illustrate implementation of this intervention, and how the peer-family format via interactive contact counteracts internalized stereotypes, encourages adaptive coping strategies, and reinvigorates social networks. Quantitative results further suggest preliminary efficacy in reducing internalized stigma for caregivers who evidenced at least some prior internalized stigma. This study constitutes an initial but important step towards reducing mental illness stigma among Asian Americans, for whom stigma has played a powerful role in the delay and underuse of treatment.

Seven‐year follow‐up study of symptoms in asylum seekers and refugees with PTSD treated with trauma‐focused groups,"Objective: To examine sustainability of symptom outcomes of a 1‐year phase‐based trauma‐focused, multimodal, and multicomponent group therapy in a day treatment program for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) over an average period of 7 years. Method: Iranian and Afghan patients (N = 69) were assessed with self‐rated symptom checklists for PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms before (T1), after (T2), and up to 11 years upon completion of the treatment (T3). A series of mixed model regression analyses was applied to determine the course of the measured symptoms over time. Results: At T2, all symptoms were reduced, but PTSD symptoms showed the strongest reduction. The trend of symptom reduction continued up to 5 years posttreatment and was similar for all the examined symptoms. After 5 years, all symptoms started to worsen, but remained under baseline levels at T3. Conclusions: The applied treatment appears to improve mental health of the studied sample on both the short and longer term.

Religion and spirituality in group counseling: Beliefs and preferences of university counseling center clients,"The main purpose of the present study was to explore client beliefs and preferences regarding the discussion of religious and spiritual issues in group counseling. We collected and described both quantitative and qualitative data. One major finding of this study was that on average the majority (85%) of clients at a university counseling center (N = 68) reported that religious concerns are an appropriate topic for discussion in group counseling. However, only a minority of clients reported that they would like to discuss religious (24%) and spiritual (47%) concerns in group. Open-ended responses from participants provided reasons why they would or would not like to discuss religion and spirituality in their specific groups and provided insight into the discrepancy between their ratings of appropriateness and interest. In regression analyses, client spirituality and group engagement significantly predicted clients’ preferences to discuss both religious and spiritual issues. Majority religious affiliation also predicted preferences to discuss religious issues.

Group counseling for at-risk African American youth: A collaboration between therapists and artists,"This article includes a description of a culturally sensitive group counseling model and curriculum for African American children (ages 7–12 years old) of families with drug and alcohol addiction. Therapists-in-training, artists of color, and community agency staff collaborated to deliver expressive art activities that facilitate self-expression, self-confidence, emotion regulation, and coping and communication skills, and that enhance personal resilience and a sense of connection with one’s community. This model aims at creativity not only in the service of the children’s development as individuals, but also in the service of community building. The collaboration between partners at the levels of program planning and implementation ensures cultural relevance for the participants as it promotes diversity and growth-fostering relationships.

Religion and spirituality in group counseling: Beliefs and practices of university counseling center counselors,"Fifty-four counselors at 9 university counseling centers participated in a study regarding religion and spirituality (R/S) in group counseling. The majority indicated that R/S is an appropriate topic for group counseling and that some religious and spiritual interventions are appropriate to use. However, counselors rarely use these interventions. Counselors endorsed higher ratings for spiritual interventions compared to their religious counterparts. After reading 1 of 2 vignettes depicting either a religious or spiritual concern raised by a group client, counselors rated their likelihood of responding in different ways. We observed no differences in the responses based on the different vignettes.

Negative religious coping as a mediator of trauma symptoms in older survivors,"Forty-three spiritually distressed older women (aged 55–83) who had survived multiple types of interpersonal trauma participated in a spiritually focused group intervention designed to address spiritual struggles related to earlier abuse and to enhance spiritual coping. It was hypothesized that the intervention would increase spiritual well-being and that religious/spiritual coping would mediate the relationship between the intervention and the outcomes of depression, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and spiritual well-being. The results provide strong initial support for the importance of understanding the effect of negative religious/spiritual coping on depression and anxiety symptoms in older religious survivors of interpersonal trauma.

Exploring the influence of gender‐role socialization and objectified body consciousness on body image disturbance in breast cancer survivors,"Objective: This study aimed to explore the relationships between gender-role socialization, objectified body consciousness and quality of life in breast cancer (BC) survivors with body image (BI) disturbance post-treatment. Methods: A total of 150 BC survivors participating in an ongoing randomized clinical trial of a group psychotherapy intervention for BI-related concerns completed a baseline battery of standardized measures including the following: Body Image Scale (BIS), Body Image after Breast Cancer Questionnaire (BIBCQ), Objectified Body Consciousness Scale (OBCS) measuring Body Shame and Surveillance, Gender-Role Socialization Scale (GRSS) measuring internalization of traditional gender roles and attitudes and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Quality-of-Life Instrument (FACT-B). Correlational analyses were conducted between the two BI questionnaires, the two primary psychosocial variables GRSS and OBCS, and FACT-B. Path analysis was conducted on a proposed theoretical model delineating pathways between the two primary psychosocial variables and BI disturbance. Results: Significant positive correlations were found between the two BI scales and (a) GRSS (average r = 0.53, p &lt; 0.000), (b) Body Shame (average r = 0.53, p &lt; 0.000) and Surveillance (average r = 0.48, p &lt; 0.000). The BIS and BIBCQ were negatively associated with the FACT-B ( r = -0.62, 0.73, respectively; p &lt; 0.000). Results from the path analysis demonstrated support for the proposed model. Conclusion: Breast cancer survivors who endorsed greater internalization of traditional gender roles and attitudes, who engaged in greater self-surveillance and experienced greater body shame, reported greater BI disturbance and poorer quality of life post-treatment. Women with these predispositions are likely to be more vulnerable for psychological distress and may experience poorer adjustment after BC treatment.

Group process in the single-gender women's recovery group compared with mixed-gender group drug counseling,"Enhanced affiliation among members is thought to provide increased support for women in single-gender compared with mixed-gender group therapy for substance use disorders (SUDs) and to provide a potential mechanism of action for its efficacy. In a Stage I trial of single-gender versus mixed-gender group therapy for SUDs, we examined affiliative statements made by members in 2 group treatments—the single-gender Women's Recovery Group (WRG) and mixed-gender group drug counseling (GDC). Twenty-eight WRG and 17 GDC group therapy tapes were coded and compared for 5 types of affiliative statements. Three types of affiliative statements (agreement, supportive, and completing a thought) were highly correlated and were more frequent in WRG than in GDC ( d = 0.882, p = .27). In GDC, women were more likely to provide an affiliative statement to a male group member than any other combination of directionality ( p &lt; .01). Compared with mixed-gender group therapy, single-gender group therapy for SUDs may enhance support through greater frequency of affiliative statements.

Mexican-origin adolescents’ exploration of a group experience,"This article provides an overview of a creative and culturally aligned group intervention for adolescents of Mexican origin. Using qualitative methodology, the authors examined multiple adolescents’ experiences of participation in the group. The youth indicated that they derived positive meaning overall from activities. Activities cited as most memorable or important included those that allowed peer collaboration in completing a task and those that facilitated discussions of contextually and culturally relevant topics. Implications according to practice and training are included.

Evaluating an anxiety group for people with learning disabilities using a mixed methodology,"The effectiveness of group therapy for people with learning disabilities and anxiety management issues is reviewed. People with learning disabilities face increased levels of psychological distress compared to the general population, yet are often faced with a lack of social support and poor coping techniques to manage their distress. A 6-week cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) anxiety management group was delivered to eight adults with a mild learning disability by a trainee psychologist and an assistant psychologist. Participants’ ages ranged from 17 to 73 years. All participants lived in the local community. Not all participants had a specific anxiety diagnosis, but all required anxiety management input. A mixed methodology using quantitative and qualitative analysis of group outcomes was used. The outcomes from this group suggest that the intervention was successful in treating anxiety for people with learning disabilities. Measures included the Quality of Life Scale, the Glasgow Anxiety Scale and the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale–Learning Disability Version. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was also used. Data from interviews were coded and analysed thematically. The main themes that emerged included group versus individual input, helpful aspects of the group, talking in front of other people, group composition (including age differences), support partners, and written materials. The outcomes for this group suggest that the intervention was successful in treating anxiety for people with learning disabilities. Practical applications of group therapies for these clients are considered, and recommendations for future groups made. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods are compared.

"Who holds the key to your box? Trust, safe space, and culture","The issue of trust—loss of safety, violation of trust, and restoration of interpersonal trust—is at the heart of the experience of trauma and trauma treatment. Culture affects the conditions that contribute to a sense of safety and trust as well as the meaning of trust itself. Space—physical space, emotional space, and even spiritual space—is a factor in the creation of a sense of trust and safety. Based on an exploration of the therapeutic metaphor of a covered box, this article discusses factors related to trust and space and culture observed in the context of trauma therapy groups conducted in Ankara, Turkey, between March 2009 and May 2011. Five trauma therapy groups were conducted by a multidisciplinary, multicultural team of mental health professionals inquiring into the effects of culture on therapeutic processes in trauma. The article focuses on both practical, physical space and imagined space in relation to the therapeutic goal of reestablishing a sense of basic interpersonal trust after trauma.

A qualitative analysis of women's experiences in single-gender versus mixed-gender substance abuse group therapy,"The present study of women with substance use disorders used grounded theory to examine women’s experiences in both the Women’s Recovery Group (WRG) and a mixed-gender Group Drug Counseling (GDC). Semi-structured interviews were completed in 2005 by 28 women in a U.S. metropolitan area. Compared to GDC, women in WRG more frequently endorsed feeling safe, embracing all aspects of one’s self, having their needs met, feeling intimacy, empathy, and honesty. In addition, group cohesion and support allowed women to focus on gender-relevant topics supporting their recovery. These advantages of single-gender group therapy can increase treatment satisfaction and improve treatment outcomes.

Is legal status impacting outcomes of group therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder with male asylum seekers and refugees from Iran and Afghanistan?,"Background: Legal status and other resettlement stressors are known to impact mental health of asylum seekers and refugees. However, the ways in which they interact with treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with these populations is still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine whether legal status and other resettlement stressors influence outcomes of a trauma-focused group PTSD treatment within a day-treatment setting with asylum seekers and refugees. Methods: Sixty six male Iranian and Afghan patients with PTSD residing in the Netherlands were assessed with self-rated symptom checklists for PTSD, anxiety and depression, and a demographic questionnaire one week before and two weeks after the treatment. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to examine the impact of legal status and living arrangements on the treatment outcomes per symptom domain. Results: The results suggest that both asylum seekers and refugees can be helped with their mental health complaints with a trauma-focused group therapy for PTSD regardless of their legal status. Obtaining a refugee status in a course of the treatment appears to improve the treatment outcomes.

Exploring responses to transformative group therapy for orphaned children in the context of mass orphaning in Botswana,"In the context of AIDS, the Botswana Government has adopted a group therapy program to help large numbers of orphaned children cope with bereavement. This study explores the effectiveness of the therapy and examines how it interacts with cultural attitudes and practices concerning death. Ten orphaned children were involved in five rounds of data collection during a therapeutic retreat; eight social workers completed questionnaires concerning the effectiveness of the therapy. Most children were able to come to terms with their loss, face problems in their home and school environments, and envision ways of solving problems. All the children described benefits of group formation and the support it would provide when they returned to their home situations.

The impact of staff initiated referral and intervention protocols on symptoms of depression in people with mild intellectual disability,"It has been estimated that people with ID experience the same and possibly higher levels of depression than the general population. Referral to a General Medical Practitioner (GP) for primary care is recommended practice for people with depression and cognitive behavioural (CB) therapy is now an accepted evidence based intervention. A growing body of literature indicates that people with ID and depression may benefit from CB strategies. The aim of the current study was to compare (i) CB group intervention strategies with referral to a GP; (ii) CB group intervention strategies only; and (iii) referral to a GP only on symptoms of depression among people with mild ID. Staff from six participating agencies received training in (a) how to identify and screen individuals with mild ID for depressive symptoms and risk factors for depression, and (b) supportive referral of identified individuals to GPs for mental health services. In addition, staff from four of the agencies undertook (c) training on how to deliver group CB intervention strategies. Eighty-two participants were allocated to one of the three intervention groups. Depressive symptoms and negative automatic thoughts were assessed prior to the intervention, at the conclusion of the intervention, and at eight months follow-up. Compared to GP referral alone, those participants who received CB strategies both with and without GP referral displayed significant reductions in depressive symptoms. The use of CB strategies only also resulted in a significant reduction in frequency of negative automatic thoughts. The findings of this study support routine screening of individuals with mild ID for depression and the delivery of group CB intervention programmes by trained staff within community-based disability agencies.

"Participation, socioeconomic status and group or individual counselling intervention in individuals at high risk for type 2 diabetes: One-year follow-up study of the FIN-D2D-project","Aims: To describe socioeconomic characteristics of participants and their effect on uptake and completion of the implementation project (FIN-D2D) for the National Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Programme. Furthermore, to assess the effectiveness of individual vs. group intervention during one-year follow-up. Methods: At baseline, 2820 men and 5764 women aged &lt;65 years participated in the non-randomized implementation project in primary health care setting; one-year follow-up was available for 1067 men and 2122 women. Socioeconomic status included education and occupation. Interventions were individual and/or group-based. The changes in cardiovascular risk factors and glucose tolerance were used as measures of the effectiveness of intervention. Results: 68.4% of the men and 69.8% of the women participated in some of the intervention modalities offered. Low education and not working were related to active participation in the intervention in men. 88.2% of men and 76.1% of women selected the individual instead of group intervention. The effectiveness of individual vs. group interventions did not differ, except for minor changes in systolic blood pressure in women and glucose tolerance in men. Conclusions: Socioeconomic status modulated participation in interventions. Both types of intervention worked equally well, but participation in group intervention was low.

Association for specialists in group work: Multicultural and social justice competence principles for group workers,"The Association for Specialists in Group Work (ASGW) is committed to understanding how issues of multiculturalism and social justice affect all aspects of group work. This article reflects the updating and revision of a previous document entitled, ""Principles for Diversity-Competent Group Workers,"" which was endorsed by ASGW in 1998 and published in the Journal for Specialists in Group Work in 1999. It also uses the term multiculturalism to align with the most recent language used in multicultural counseling scholarship, which embraces a broader perspective of recognizing unique worldviews, appreciating socio-cultural differences, and facilitating the empowerment of individuals within a society. This document is the ""starting point"" for group workers as we become increasingly aware, knowledgeable, and skillful in facilitating groups whose memberships represent the diversity of our society and where group workers are conscious of and take action on issues of social justice.

Teaching story grammar components to increase oral narrative ability: A group intervention study,"This pilot study investigated the impact of an oral narrative intervention program implemented with 24 children who attended a College of Education on campus laboratory school for children with specific language learning difficulties. Oral narratives were elicited before and after treatment and underwent T-unit and story grammar component analyses. The 13 weeks of treatment involved a systematic approach to teaching story grammar components and story organization. Paired sample t -tests were conducted and a significant improvement in number of T-units and use of story grammar components was measured following intervention. These results lend preliminary support to the effectiveness of the narrative intervention implemented in a group setting.

Verbal interactions in Taiwanese group counseling process: A cross-cultural perspective,"Although group verbal behaviors have been extensively studied, little research has examined how the types and frequencies of interactions vary across cultures. The purpose of this study was to examine verbal interactions in the Taiwanese group counseling process from a cultural perspective. 58 students were recruited from seven colleges of a comprehensive university in Taiwan. They were randomly assigned to one of the following: the Family Reconstruction group, Transactional Analysis group, or Growth group, as well as three Counseling groups. By using the Hill Interaction Matrix–SS (HIM–SS), participants’ verbal interactions in the three groups were coded. Personal and Relationship Content verbal interactions were frequently used and the Confrontative and Assertive Work verbal interactions were least used in the group process. Personal, Relationship, Conventional, and Speculative verbal interactions were ranked high, but those of Group, Topics, Confrontative, and Assertive were much less used by both leaders and members. The differences of the verbal interactions and Silence responses between leaders and members in counseling groups were examined; there were no significant differences between the leaders’ and members’ verbal interactions and Silence. Specific types of verbal interactions influenced by cultural issues were discussed.

Group therapy with male asylum seekers and refugees with posttraumatic stress disorder: A controlled comparison cohort study of three day-treatment programs,"Studies on group treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in asylum seekers and refugees are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of three different trauma-focused day-treatment group programs for treatment of PTSD in male asylum seekers and refugees. Three treatment groups ( n = 56) and a waitlisted control group ( n = 16) of help-seeking Iranian and Afghani patients were assessed with a set of self-rated symptom checklists for PTSD, anxiety, depression, and psychoticism 1 week before and 2 weeks after treatment. There are no indications that the 2 days’ group program with three nonverbal and two group psychotherapy sessions per week is less effective in reducing symptoms than the program with the same amount of sessions spread over 3 days per week. The trauma-focused day-treatment group seems a promising approach for treatment of PTSD among asylum seekers and refugees in industrialized settings.

Superiority of group counseling to individual coaching for parents of children with learning disabilities,"Two interventions for parents of children with learning disabilities (LD)—individual coaching and group counseling—were compared. Participants were 169 parents, non-randomly assigned to three experimental conditions: coaching ( n = 45), group counseling ( n = 93) and control ( n = 31). Variables included outcomes (parental stress and parental coping), personal (perceived social support) and process (bonding with therapist/group). Findings indicated more favorable outcomes for parents in both treatment conditions compared to control, more favorable outcomes on the stress index for parents treated in groups compared to individual coaching, and bonding was the most consistent predictor of outcomes. The discussion focuses on the power of group counseling for parents of children with LD.

Perceptions of group climate by social identity group in intergroup dialogue,"This study examined how individuals from social identity groups with differing levels of societal power and privilege perceived the group climate of five intergroup dialogue groups at a large university. Over the course of seven weeks, dialogue participants from social identity groups who are the targets of societal oppression (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people; people of color; women) perceived significant increases in engagement within the group climate, and significant decreases in conflict. However, dialogue participants from agent social identity groups (e.g., heterosexual people, White people, men) did not perceive any significant changes in engagement or conflict over the course of the groups. Neither those from the target social identity groups, nor those from agent social identity groups perceived significant changes in levels of avoidance over time. These findings are discussed in relation to a four-stage, critical-dialogic model of intergroup dialogue.

Drums and poems: An intervention promoting empathic connection and literacy in children,"Expressive therapies can be used with groups of children to increase empathy and reduce bullying and violence. When educators feel pressured to focus on standardized tests and basic skills, there is little attention and time for such programs. Drums and Poems is an intervention that counselors and teachers can use to address these problems by teaching literacy skills and empathic connection-building skills simultaneously. Group leaders incorporate relational–cultural theory (RCT) and elements of music and poetry therapy in a preventive group intervention for at-risk 7- to 9-year olds. They focus on the empathic process as children create poems as a group, supporting the RCT aspects of the intervention. This article includes an explanation of the Drums and Poems technique and the relational concepts that inform it, introducing the concept of empowered belonging. The use of relational–cultural concepts such as empathy, power-with, relational images, and controlling images are explained.

Disability and countertransference in group psychotherapy,"Psychoanalysis has paid limited attention to disability, and at times the approach has lacked political awareness. Over recent decades the international disability rights movement has argued that disabled people constitute an oppressed, systemically disadvantaged minority. Lately, a critical psychoanalytic vieiv has connected disablist discrimination to universal unconscious conflicts evoked by impairment. Corresponding evocations emerge in the therapeutic frame, producing countertransference responses to the impaired body. Drawing on psychoanalytically oriented group psychotherapy zvith severely physically impaired adults, counter transference phenomena were studied in developing discussion on disability-related clinical work. The complex, uncertain role of psychoanalytic practice in combating oppression was also examined.

Attending to religion and spirituality in group counseling: Counselors' perceptions and practices,"Although consensus is building that religion and spirituality are important aspects of individual counseling, there has been little exploration of these topics in group counseling. The current online questionnaire study provided a description of how 242 experienced group counselors approach religion and spirituality in group counseling. Interventions that were less active and less directly tied to religious or spiritual practices were viewed as the most appropriate. Spiritual interventions were seen as more appropriate and were used more frequently than corresponding religious interventions. Counselors reported infrequent use of religious and spiritual interventions, even when they were viewed as appropriate. Counselors' degree of religious commitment and spirituality were positively correlated with appropriateness and use of religious and spiritual interventions. Finally, open-ended comments revealed that many counselors saw therapeutic value in discussing religion and spirituality in group counseling, but also cautioned against the negative interactions and unproductive group work that might occur as a result of such discussions.

"Culture, context and therapeutic processes: Delivering a parent-child intervention in a remote aboriginal community","Objective: Little is written about the process of delivering mainstream, evidence-based therapeutic interventions for Aboriginal children and families in remote communities. Patterns of interaction between parents and children and expectations about parenting and professional roles and responsibilities vary across cultural contexts. This can be a challenging experience for professionals accustomed to work in urban settings. Language is only a part of cultural difference, and the outsider in a therapeutic group in an Aboriginal community is outside not only in language but also in access to community relationships and a place within those relationships. Method: This paper uses examples from Let’s Start, a therapeutic parent-child intervention to describe the impact of distance, culture and relationships in a remote Aboriginal community, on the therapeutic framework, group processes and relationships. Results: Cultural and contextual factors influence communication, relationships and group processes in a therapeutic group program for children and parents in a remote Aboriginal community. Group leaders from within and from outside the community, are likely to have complementary skills. Conclusions: Cultural and contextual factors influence communication, relationships and group processes in a therapeutic group program for children and parents in a remote Aboriginal community. Group leaders from within and from outside the community, are likely to have complementary skills. Program adaptation, evaluation and staff training and support need to take these factors into account to ensure cultural accessibility without loss of therapeutic fidelity and efficacy.

Effectiveness of the coping power program in a Mexican-American sample: Distinctive cultural considerations,"This study responds to the challenges associated with delivering culturally sensitive and evidence-based treatment (EBT) to at-risk children. Current research supports group interventions based on the Coping Power Program (CPP) curriculum as EBT for improving the frequency of positive behaviors in children and adolescents. However, the effectiveness of the CPP in a Mexican-American sample has not been explored to date. This study investigated the effectiveness of the CPP delivered as a preventative intervention to Mexican-American adolescents in a rural school setting. A major emphasis is put on cultural sensitivity when working with this population. Cultural sensitivity is expressed by minor adaptations of the CPP. The adaptations consisted of modifying treatment content, providing culturally relevant examples, contextualizing content and so forth, while maintaining program value. Our hypothesis was that when using the adapted EBT curriculum on the Mexican-American subsample, both groups would have similar scores and retention rates. As hypothesized, no significant differences were found between the two treatment groups (non-adapted EBT European-American and adapted EBT Mexican-American). Overall, the results suggest that EBT interventions for at-risk Mexican-American youth might require cultural adaptation in order to maximize its effectiveness.

The effectiveness of a short-term group music therapy intervention for parents who have a child with a disability,"Background: The positive relationship between parent-child interactions and optimal child development is well established. Families of children with disabilities may face unique challenges in establishing positive parent-child relationships; yet, there are few studies examining the effectiveness of music therapy interventions to address these issues. In particular, these studies have been limited by small sample size and the use of measures of limited reliability and validity. Objective: This study examined the effectiveness of a short-term group music therapy intervention for parents of children with disabilities and explored factors associated with better outcomes for participating families. Methods: Participants were 201 mother-child dyads, where the child had a disability. Pre- and post-intervention parental questionnaires and clinician observation measures were completed to examine outcomes of parental wellbeing, parenting behaviors, and child development. Descriptive data, t-tests for repeated measures and a predictive model tested via logistic regression are presented. Results: Significant improvements pre to. post intervention were found for parent mental health, child communication and social skills, parenting sensitivity, parental engagement with child and acceptance of child, child responsiveness to parent, and child interest and participation in program activities. There was also evidence for high parental satisfaction and that the program brought social benefits to families. Reliable change on six or more indicators of parent or child functioning was predicted by attendance and parent education. Conclusions: This study provides positive evidence for the effectiveness of group music therapy in promoting improved parental mental health, positive parenting and key child developmental areas.

Vida Alegre: Preliminary findings of a depression intervention for immigrant Latino mothers,"Objectives: This article reports the outcome of a pilot study of a cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) intervention— Vida Alegre (the contented life)—designed for use with depressed immigrant mothers living in communities with small but rapidly growing Hispanic populations. Method: The study used a pretest/posttest/follow-up design to examine whether exposure to the intervention reduced symptoms of depression. Results: Although based on a small, nonrandomized sample, the results are promising at pretest/baseline, the average Center for Epidemiology Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) score was 25; at posttest and follow-up, the average CES-D scores were 12 and 11.3, respectively. Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests showed that the pretest and posttest scores are significantly different ( Z = –2.22, p &lt; .05, r = .67), indicating a decline in depression. A content analysis of transcripts from three focus groups indicates the usefulness of intervention. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that an existing CBGT can be modified to address immigrant issues.

Group therapy for refugees and torture survivors: Treatment model innovations,"The paper discusses varieties of group therapies with refugees and torture survivors and the logic behind enhancing traditional group therapies to fit the unique experiences of refugees and torture survivors. It discusses some lessons learned from practice and from empirical research and some recommended adaptations. Finally, it discusses the Center for Torture and Trauma Survivors' therapy group model for torture survivors and describes two of its variants: The Bashal group for African and Somali women and the Bhutanese multi-family therapy group. Group therapies, in this model, extend to community healing. One of the essential and innovative features of the model is that it focuses not only on treating individual psychopathology but also extends to community healing by promoting the development of social clubs and organizations that promote the values and culture of the graduates of the therapy group and the continuation of social support.

Efficacy of writing for recovery on traumatic grief symptoms of Afghani refugee bereaved adolescents: A randomized control trial,"Effective evidence-based intervention for traumatic bereavement is one of the current major research issues in the field of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents. The ""Writing for Recovery"" group intervention is a new treatment approach developed by the Children and War Foundation for traumatized and bereaved children and adolescents after disasters. The purpose of this project was an empirical examination of this intervention with 12- to 18-year-old war bereaved Afghani refugees. Eighty-eight war bereaved Afghani refugees were screened using the Traumatic Grief Inventory for Children (TGIC). From those with the highest total score, 61 were randomly assigned to either an experimental ( n = 29) or control group ( n = 32). The experimental group received six sessions of group training on 3 consecutive days in their school. The difference of TGIC scores between the experimental group in pretest and posttest was significant ( p = 0.001). Results of analysis of covariance also showed a significant effect of Writing for Recovery on the experimental group ( p &lt; 0.001). It is concluded that ""Writing for Recovery"" is an effective group intervention for bereaved children and adolescents after disasters.

Using group therapy to navigate and resolve sexual orientation and religious conflicts,"This article considers the use of group therapy to explore sexual identity questions in light of religious beliefs and values. The authors describe the basis of their group therapy approaches for sexual, religious, and social conflicts that differ from approaches that provide group members only the option of sexual reorientation to an ex-gay identity or adoption of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual identity. The authors come from different backgrounds and discuss how their perspectives and biases can potentially affect group process and outcome. They present guidelines, structure, content, and strategies for their group therapy approaches.

Group psychotherapy for trauma-related disorders in people with intellectual disabilities,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is threefold: to summarize data on rates of sexual abuse and interpersonal trauma in people with intellectual disability (ID); to demonstrate the relationship between such trauma and psychological distress; and to describe a promising treatment technique for such exposed individuals. Design/methodology/approach: A review of the literature on rates of abuse and trauma among people with ID is presented with particular attention paid to the role of developmental level in both the experience and impact of trauma. Drawing from this understanding of the phenomenology of traumatic exposure in people with ID, the authors present a theoretical framework for psychotherapeutic intervention. Findings: This paper establishes the inverse relationship between the higher-than-average rates of trauma and interpersonal violence in the ID population, co-occurring with lower-than-average access to treatment, and lower-than-average treatment model development for this population. Further, this paper provides a description of a theoretically based therapeutic intervention with preliminary research efficacy. Practical implications: This paper documents three key areas in need of attention in order to reduce the suffering of people with ID: the need to address the high rates of exposure to abuse; the importance of taking into account developmental level when assessing the impact of potentially traumatic experiences; and the efficacy of the interactive-behavioral model of group psychotherapy for people with ID who have trauma-related distress. Originality/value: This paper points to the need for systematic efforts to reduce the rate of traumatic exposure to which people with ID are disproportionately exposed. Moreover, it establishes how important the role of developmental level is in understanding how exposure to abuse may result in the development of psychological disorders. Finally, this paper provides a clear understanding of a targeted therapeutic approach and the need for a system of accessible care so that afflicted individuals may have the benefit of such therapy.

Gender dynamics in group therapy,"Gender dynamics are important for both group members and group leaders. Differences in the way boys and girls solve the universal problem of separating from the preoedipal mother play themselves out in the way group members focus on or defend against empathy and autonomy. Gender plays a role with group leaders, too, because groups led by a symbolic father will have different challenges than a mother-led group.

S/he stole my jouissance! A Lacanian approach to gender in the group,"This article takes a Lacanian psychoanalytic perspective to group work and, more specifically, to the ways in which working through conflicts related to gender may be achieved in a group setting. Lacan's theory adds to our understanding of how to orient group therapy in three major ways. First, Lacan's theory of feminine and masculine subjectivity is not reducible to biological sex binaries. Lacan's corresponding conceptions of phallic and Other jouissance are discussed in tandem with masculine and female subjectivity to elucidate the ways in which they manifest themselves in the group process. Second, Lacan's theory of subjectivity and its relation to language supports the notion of the social and historical construction of gender norms and the benefits of deconstructing gender norms in the larger effort to work through one's conflicts with the Other. Third, Lacan's theory reveals that many of our gender stereotypes are shaped by the frequent co-occurrence of obsession and masculinity and hysteria and femininity. Obsession and hysteria are briefly explained. These three aspects of Lacanian theory are discussed with the aid of group examples to show how interpreting the group process through these lenses can highlight the group's issues relating to gender.

Exploring how young people living in foster care discuss spiritually sensitive themes in a holistic arts-based group program,"Holistic arts-based group methods are well suited to facilitating spiritually sensitive discussions with young people. This paper briefly describes some of these group methods that have been found to be feasible, suitable, and beneficial for children and youth living in foster care for developing aspects of their resilience. Qualitative analysis is presented and illustrates how the young people made sense of spirituality and discussed spiritually sensitive themes in the group. We found that most of the young people had ideas about spirituality and that most of the spiritually sensitive discussions could be related to issues of death and/or loss. Their narratives, however brief, offered rich material for exploration. Helping practitioners should consider how spiritually sensitive methods can occur with children/youth because young people may raise these issues themselves, spiritually sensitive issues may be integral to the problems they present, and/or may be intimately connected with their cultural beliefs and practices.

Psychotherapy groups for traumatized refugees and asylum seekers,"Two ways in which the concrete intrudes into the therapeutic space of psychotherapy groups for traumatized refugees and asylum seekers are explored. Concrete intrusions, which are the result of historical traumatic events, are distinguished from those which are the result of the contemporary socio-political context. Groups can help work through the former as an essential part of the therapy and need to find ways of working with the latter. The historical intrusions are aligned to the loss of the ability to symbolize. Connections between the (interpersonal) loss of the ability to trust, which characterizes groups for this population, and the (intrapersonal) loss of the ability to symbolize are explored. With the use of clinical illustrations, the article emphasizes the way in which the group therapy setting provides a space in which to rebuild the ability to trust, which is so personally and politically poignant for this client group. Moreover, finding ways of working with contemporary intrusions may benefit trust and the therapeutic alliance.

"Group counseling with international students: Practical, ethical, and cultural considerations","International students in higher education represent a diverse population with unique mental health needs. Foreign students commonly experience a host of adjustment issues, including acculturative stress, language difficulties, cultural misunderstandings, racial discrimination, and loss of social support. Despite their challenges, few international students seek individual counseling. The purpose of this article is to present counseling groups as a treatment modality for addressing international students’ adjustment concerns. Special attention is directed to the practical, ethical, and cultural challenges of conducting group counseling with this population, in addition to presenting recommendations for future practice and research.

Group therapy with traumatized asylum seekers and refugees: For whom it works and for whom it does not?,"The aim of this study was to examine the influence of psychosocial stressors and demographic factors on psychopathology in asylum seekers and refugees with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prior to participation in the Den Bosch model for group treatment, as well as to explore their influence on the treatment results. The results showed no significant differences in the mean levels of psychopathology between asylum seekers and refugees prior to treatment. There were no differences found in treatment outcomes between the two groups. Living conditions do not influence either the mean levels of psychopathology prior to treatment or the treatment effects in our sample. The participants who are living separated from their families and/or who are single show the same levels of PTSD and depressive complaints prior to and post treatment compared with participants living together with family members. Ongoing psychosocial stressors in the course of treatment had no impact on treatment outcomes. Torture survivors, war victims, and a torture/war group profited equally from group treatment effectiveness. The results suggest that the effects of group therapy with asylum seekers and refugees according to the Den Bosch model are not impacted by demographic characteristics of the participants.

Evaluation of group therapy with traumatized asylum seekers and refugees—The Den Bosch Model,"In this study, treatment results of three different trauma-focus group day-treatment programs for asylum seekers and refugees with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), were compared with a supportive outpatient psychotherapy group, and a waiting list control group. The group programs differed in the number of nonverbal therapy sessions combined with group psychotherapy and in the number of treatment days per week that the programs were executed. The results suggest that trauma-focus day-treatment groups lead to a significant decrease of psychopathology compared with the outpatient supportive group psychotherapy and the control group. Within the day-treatment programs, the more nonverbal treatment sessions are applied in a week time, the better the results. Equal treatment effects were obtained with the same number of sessions per week applied over 2 and over 3 days.

Spirituality and religion in group counseling: A literature review with practice guidelines,"There has been increased discussion of the need to attend to clients' spirituality and religion as a part of the counseling process, but much of the literature to date has focused on individual counseling. How do the research and resulting practice implications apply to group counseling? This article provides a rationale for attending to spirituality and religion in counseling, explores the opportunities and barriers in attending to spirituality and religion in group counseling, and reviews the literature on the growing number of group interventions with a spiritual or religious focus. The article ends with specific guidelines for when and how to incorporate spirituality and religion into group counseling.

"The value of psychodynamic group psychotherapy with underserved, multicultural youth","This article will describe treatment of culturally diverse high-risk adolescents in closed-setting probation schools under the authority of the juvenile court system. The adolescents are delayed in their educational achievement and have had contact with the court system, most often related to gang membership behavior or substance abuse. Participation in treatment is voluntary. The treatment and administration of the program are provided by a mental health center that employs the staff clinicians and program administrators. Graduate psychology and social work students provide the majority of the treatment. The article describes the task of creating a therapuetic enviornment in which systemic elements, that is, school administrative considerations, gang loyalty, and acting out, are antigroup norms. Clinical examples from group therapy will illustrate some of the tasks and achievements of this endeavor.

Development of a safety awareness group intervention for women with diverse disabilities: A pilot study,"Objective: Describe the development and preliminary evaluation of a safety awareness program for women with disabilities. Design: Baseline and postintervention questionnaires administered to a sample of women who completed a safety awareness program. Participants: Seven women with diverse disabilities. Intervention: Eight interactive sessions designed to increase protective factors. Setting: Community site for persons with disabilities. Main Outcomes: Safety self-efficacy, safety skills, social support/isolation, and safety promoting behaviors. Results: Significant increases from baseline to postintervention were found on measures of self-efficacy and safety skills. Although not statistically significant, improvements were also found in safety promoting behavior. Conclusion: Despite the small sample, findings suggest that participation in a safety awareness program may improve protective factors.

The effectiveness of gender role re-evaluation and non-gender-focused group psychotherapy in the treatment of recently separated men,"This article explores the viability of Gender Role Re-Evaluation (GRE) and Non Gender-Focused (NGF) group psychotherapy with recently separated men. Sixty-one participants were randomly distributed into three GRE or three NGF groups. Eleven psychometric measures were administered at pre-pre-group, pre-group, post-group and six-week follow-up. Results of a repeated-measures MANOVA revealed significant changes in Emotional Expression, Self and Other Orientation, and Psychological Well-Being, maintained at six-week follow-up. As the first randomized empirical investigation of men’s consciousness-raising groups and gender role re-evaluation psychotherapy groups for men, these results provide a more positive re-framing of men’s accessible potential for positive therapeutic change in groups, and a more hopeful perspective of the therapeutic potential of group psychotherapy with men undergoing a major psychosocial crisis.

Applying social justice to oppression and marginalization in group process: Interventions and strategies for group counselors,"A call from the group counseling literature (Brown, 2009) recognizes the need for theoretical and empirical writings that explore the intersection of social justice and counseling practice, as many counselors are unprepared to address the impact of oppression and privilege on group process. The authors explore these issues by making recommendations and offering five strategies to assist in group discussions of marginalization, privilege, and oppression into group theory. These strategies include ways to assist counselors in recognizing how group members may oppress one another as well as specific recommendations from two current group counselors who practice social justice.

“I'm not lazy; it's just that I learn differently”: Development and implementation of a manualized school-based group for students with learning disabilities,"In this article the authors present the implementation and pilot evaluation of an innovative manualized school-based group for middle-school students with a learning disability (LD). The group was one component of a school-based intervention that was a collaboration of university-based researchers, children’s mental health, and education. Interviews were held with selected students, their parents, and teachers to obtain their views of the group. Preliminary findings suggest that the group improved students’ knowledge of their LD, increased their ability to ask for help and self-advocate, and enhanced their confidence. The group leaders found the manualized group beneficial and offered recommendations for change. Practice principles in providing group for students with LD are offered.

Children with and without learning disabilities: A comparison of processes and outcomes following group counseling,"This study compared outcomes and processes in counseling groups of an expressive-supportive modality for children with learning disabilities (LD) and without them (NLD). Participants were 266 students (ages 10—18), all referred for emotional, social, and behavioral difficulties; of these, 123 were identified with LD and 143 were not. There were 40 groups in all—20 with LD children and 20 with NLD. Outcome variables included adjustment, social competence, and academic achievements. Process variables included bonding, group functioning, and client behavior. Analyses were nested using mixed models. Results indicated no differences in outcomes or process variables between populations except for academic achievements; some between-group differences were found in the effect of processes on outcomes. It was concluded that children with LD may be successfully treated in expressive-supportive counseling groups for their emotional and social difficulties.

Cognitive behavioral group therapy for mood management in individuals with intellectual disabilities: A pilot study,"Individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) often display mental health symptoms that may benefit from psychotherapy. In this pilot study, a newly designed cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) group treatment targeting mood difficulties was provided to 8 adults with mild-borderline ID. Assessment occurred at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 4 month follow-up using the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised. The findings suggest a significant within-group effect between the therapeutic intervention and 6 symptom dimensions from pretreatment to posttreatment; however, no significant effects were maintained at follow-up. Findings suggest individuals with mild-moderate ID may benefit from CBT for mood management. Implications for future research are discussed.

"Diversity and group theory, practice, and research","Argues that the relatively scant attention to diversity issues in the articles in this special issue are a microcosm of the field as a whole. The group psychotherapy literature continues to be characterized generally by 1) broad attention to diversity but with limited specificity, 2) limited or absent focus on traditionally underrepresented racial/ethnic minority groups, 3) unintentional neglect of important practice implications for minorities, and 4) hesitancy to address dominant-minority relations and the Eurocentric history of the field. While there has been an intermittent focus on diversity issues in the theory, research, and practice of group counseling, there is little to no evidence of a systematic and sustainable literature base which builds significantly upon previous theory and findings.

"Shame, gender, and sexuality in gay men's group therapy","This article will demonstrate how vital it is for group therapists to pay special attention to the intertwining of shame and identity, which compromise the gay man's ability to connect. Because gender and sexuality are so central to one's sense of self early deep shaming of a gay man's gender role and sexuality can have a devastating impact on his fullest experience of self and connection to others. To that end, after introducing the author's nonlinear perspective, the article first looks at the universal primacy of shame in everyone's emotional life. Next, the article examines specific ways that shame can shape gay men's development of sexuality and gender role. Finally, the article asserts the transformational power of gay men's group therapy, at various stages of group development, to manage shame and affirm fuller engagement in life.

Socio-cultural influence on group therapy leadership style,"The main author of this article had the opportunity to witness, to observe and to be trained in two different styles of group therapy leadership over the past few years: A more directive, prescriptive and active style that was developed in Egypt and is considered as the traditional Egyptian style of conducting dynamic therapy groups (Egyptian Integrative Dynamic Model) and a less directive, more descriptive and passive style that was developed in the UK and is considered as the traditional style of leading dynamic therapy groups within the British National Health Service (British Group Analysis). The article tries to investigate the socio-cultural factors that favoured adopting the more directive, prescriptive and active format in the Egyptian model although it revolves around the same object–relations theoretical core as the British one. This might stimulate an interesting discussion on the relativity of psychotherapy concepts, processes and aims among different cultures.

Multicultural competence and evidence-based practice in group therapy,"The multicultural competence (MC) and evidence-based practice (EBP) initiatives have each generated healthy debates in the mental health field, with ample implications for clinical training and practice. Using two case illustrations, we highlight practical challenges and prospects in the intersection of MC and EBP. To facilitate complementary practice of MC and EBP, we offer strategies for the group therapist as a ""local clinical scientist"" to deliver culturally responsive treatments. We stress the importance of cultural adaptation of EBP models, namely, modifying evidence-based interventions that involve changes in service delivery, in the nature of the therapeutic relationship, or in components of the treatment itself to accommodate the cultural beliefs and behaviors of racial-cultural minority clients. Cultural adaptation of EBP in group therapy needs to be grounded in developmental contextualism and social justice. We discuss the two cases with an eye toward advancing multicultural competence in group therapy.

"Social privilege, social justice, and group counseling: An inquiry","The construct of social privilege is ubiquitous within the multicultural and social justice literature. However, the group work literature has yet to integrate the construct into group theory, processes, and training. In this article, we review the group literature on multicultural and diversity issues. Also, we examine the multicultural and social justice literature for an operational definition of social privilege. Finally, we make an argument for the impact of social privilege on group work and for the necessity of integrating social justice competencies into group work.

Focus groups: Examining a community-based group intervention for depressed Puerto Rican women,"Puerto Ricans manifest high rates of depression but avoid seeking treatment. The purpose of this pilot was to learn directly from Puerto Rican women how culturally appropriate they would consider a proposed community-based intervention for treating depression. Interactive activities were reviewed by two focus groups of women (N = 16), all working in community-based health programs. All activities (e.g., writing, role playing, and music) except individual drawing were deemed appropriate. Categories that emerged were family/community values, mainland/non-mainland cultural variances, communication style, religion, education/occupational variances, health beliefs, Puerto Rican traditions/customs, emotions, and coping skills. Categories provided guidance for refining a community-based intervention for treating depression in Puerto Rican women.

Arab and Israeli counseling trainees: A comparison of ethnically homogeneous and heterogeneous groups,"The study compared Arab and Jewish trainees in ethnically homogeneous and heterogeneous groups, in 1 counselor training program in Israel. The 60 participants were divided into 4 conditions: Jewish trainees in homogeneous and heterogeneous groups (n=15 in each), and Arab trainees in homogeneous and heterogeneous groups (n=15 in each). Functioning in the group was measured through group climate (engagement, conflict, and avoidance), group intimacy, self-disclosure, and regret of disclosure. Results indicated cultural differences only on self-disclosure, with Arabs scoring lower than Jews on several dimensions. Group composition differences were mainly indicated on the climate measure, with higher scores in the heterogeneous group on conflict and avoidance, and lower scores on regret of feeling exposure. Culture-by-group interactions were found for engagement, self-disclosure, and regret after disclosure about self, with Arabs in heterogeneous groups scoring higher on the first 2 and lower on the third. These results recommend placing Arab trainees in heterogeneous groups.

Cultural competence in a group intervention designed for Latino patients living with HIV/AIDS,"Although the trajectory of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has changed dramatically over the past 25 years, addressing the psychosocial needs of patients living with HIV/AIDS remains vital. Ensuring the effective delivery of services demands that interventions be rooted in cultural competence and aimed at vulnerable populations. This article describes a group intervention designed for Latino patients living with HIV/AIDS in New York City. The intervention effectively integrates culturally competent practice with traditional social work practice with groups' skills to provide an arena for participants to explore issues commonly faced by patients living with HIV/AIDS in a cultural context. Case examples are used to describe themes that emerged during the intervention, which illustrate cultural influences on issues such as adherence, social isolation, stigma, disclosure, safer sex practices, and patient-provider communication. Cultural factors inherent to Latino culture that are known to influence a patient's health experience and the development of effective interventions are also presented. The identification and explanation of these factors is intended to help social workers and other health care professionals better understand the roots of Latino patients' beliefs and understanding of their HIV/AIDS condition as well as highlight some of the obstacles they cause.

Evaluating a multiple-family group access intervention for refugees with PTSD,"The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of a multiple-family group in increasing access to mental health services for refugees with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study investigated a nine-session multiple-family group called Coffee and Families Education and Support with refugee families from Bosnia-Herzegovina in Chicago. Adults with PTSD (n = 197) and their families were randomly assigned to receive either the intervention or a control condition. The results indicated that a multiple-family group was effective in increasing access to mental health services and that depression and family comfort with discussing trauma mediated the intervention effect. Further well-designed studies of family interventions are needed for developing evidence-based interventions for refugee families.

"Group therapy and ""women of a certain age.""","The sexual revolution and women's liberation have led to increased interest in the way gender impacts on psychodynamics as well as the therapy group. Furthermore, as the baby boomers reach midlife and older, it is important to consider the challenges such women face as well as their particular power and resilience as they are expressed in the therapy group. In addition, women still comprise a majority of psychotherapy patients and are now becoming a majority in clinical training programs. For these reasons, the author addresses the particular issues and concerns of women in midlife in their groups and speaks to the dilemmas faced by both patients and therapists. She utilizes a combined psychodynamic and group dynamic perspective, emphasizing transference and countertransference as they become manifest in the group, reviewing selected literature on women in midlife and identifying the key personal issues they face at that time in terms of both core gender identity and gender role expectations. Citing her own research, the author suggests how women face new challenges based on bodily changes and shifting role relationships, and how they also perceive new strengths and possibilities in their lives. Relational psychology emphasizes interdependence, rather than autonomous self-sufficiency, as a mature ideal, which is consistent with feminist perspectives. Furthermore, and paradoxically, the author agrees with Jung that as women mature, they may incorporate more of the masculine animus into their personalities. Yet for women to disavow their traditional roles and identifications would be a mistake. Transference and countertransference are influenced by the sex of the therapist. For example, male patients may suppress erotic transference to female therapists. Conversely, the female therapist must identify her hidden biases, for example, for or against women-as-housewives and mothers, or else she may misunderstand female patients whose biases differ from her own.

Feminist group counseling with south Asian women who have survived intimate partner violence,"This article examines how to use a feminist approach in group counseling with South Asian women who have survived intimate partner violence (IPV). South Asian culture, including gender-role expectations and attitudes about family violence, is discussed.

Finding a home: Group psychotherapy for traumatized refugees and asylum seekers,"Group therapy is a useful form of intervention for individuals with histories of extreme trauma. This paper will discuss the relevance of group interventions with refugees and asylum seekers who have suffered persecution and trauma in their home countries. Using case examples, this paper will illustrate how groups can provide an environment in which members can begin to work through past traumatic experiences and begin the process of finding a home in the UK, within a context of continued uncertainty and threat. The central principles of group analytic psychotherapy and how these can be applied and adapted to meet the needs of this specific group will be explored. Key issues, including working with an interpreter, cultural factors and dealing with high levels of vulnerability and dependency, will be discussed. The complex boundary issues arising from needing to intervene with practical issues outside the group therapy process will be considered. The paper will also explore the impact of this work on the group facilitators and ways in which this can be managed.

The women's recovery group study: A stage I trial of women-focused group therapy for substance use disorders versus mixed-gender group drug counseling,"The aim of this Stage I Behavioral Development Trial was to develop a manual-based 12-session Women's Recovery Group (WRG) and to pilot test this new treatment in a randomized controlled trial against a mixed-gender Group Drug Counseling (GDC), an effective manual-based treatment for substance use disorders. After initial manual development, two pre-pilot groups of WRG were conducted to determine feasibility and initial acceptability of the treatment among subjects and therapists. In the pilot stage, women were randomized to either WRG or GDC. No significant differences in substance use outcomes were found between WRG and GDC during the 12-week group treatment. However, during the 6-month post-treatment follow-up, WRG members demonstrated a pattern of continued reductions in substance use while GDC women did not. In addition, pilot WRG women with alcohol dependence had significantly greater reductions in average drinks/drinking day than GDC women 6 months post-treatment (p &lt; .03, effect size = 0.81). While satisfaction with both groups was high, women were significantly more satisfied with WRG than GDC (p &lt; .009, effect size = 1.11). In this study, the newly developed 12-session women-focused WRG was feasible with high satisfaction among participants. It was equally effective as mixed-gender GDC in reducing substance use during the 12-week in-treatment phase, but demonstrated significantly greater improvement in reductions in drug and alcohol use over the post-treatment follow-up phase compared with GDC. A women-focused single-gender group treatment may enhance longer-term clinical outcomes among women with substance use disorders.

Therapeutic Bonding in Group as an Explanatory Variable of Progress in the Social Competence of Students With Learning Disabilities,"This study, conducted in Israel, explores the efficacy of an expressive-supportive group psychotherapy in helping adolescents with learning disabilities (LD) and attention deficits (ADD and ADHD) to increase social competence and friendship. Bonding with the therapist and group members was tested as an explanatory variable of outcomes. The study included 87 students with LD from seven different schools who had been referred to school counseling centers because of social, emotional, and behavior difficulties. The students in each school were randomly divided into experimental and wait-list conditions. Children in the experimental conditions (n = 42) participated in seven small groups, in 15 weekly sessions of group therapy conducted by trained school counselors. Results indicated gains on the social competence measure, but not on the friendship-intimacy measure. Therapist-related bonding was more frequently related to outcomes than member-related bonding.

Group therapy as treatment for depressed Latino women: A review of the literature,"Group therapy has been recommended as a treatment for depression among Latino women. Thus, the literature published between 1980 and 2004 was systematically reviewed to explore cultural and therapeutic factors relevant to group therapy for depressed Latino women. The specific aims were to: (1) determine the type of studies on this topic, (2) identify successful forms of group therapy for this population, (3) identify therapeutic factors to consider while dealing with this population in group therapy, and (4) explore guidelines for conducting culturally sensitive groups for this population. Cognitive behavioral group therapy is recommended, yet few experimental studies have explored culturally relevant variations of this treatment. Culturally relevant therapeutic factors were mentioned in all studies.

Can talking about oppression reduce depression? Modified CBT group treatment for LGBT people with depression,"Research has demonstrated that rates of depression are elevated among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) people as a result of social stigmatization. However, few studies have investigated interventions which address the proposed causes of depression for LGBT people (i.e., internalized and external oppression). This study tested a cognitive behavioural therapy-based group intervention for LGBT people living with depression, which was delivered based on anti-oppression principles and included sessions on coming out and internalized homophobia. Participants demonstrated statistically significant reductions in symptoms of depression, and statistically significant increases in self-esteem, following the intervention. Implications for service delivery to LGBT people are discussed.

Running from the demon: Culturally specific group therapy for depressed Hmong women in a family medicine residency clinic,"This exploratory study utilized qualitative data from three sets of baseline and post-treatment focus groups to explore the expectations, perceptions, and experience of 14 Hmong women participants in therapy groups conducted in a primary care setting. This new therapy group intervention, based on relational/cultural theory and using narrative therapy, was designed to be culturally specific while striving for integration, and multidisciplinary in order to reflect the interconnection among an array of factors affecting mental health. Participants were generally positive in their assessment of the therapy group experience and made few negative comments about the group. The data suggest that this intervention is effective in helping Hmong women to gain social and emotio support, be able to identify coping mechanisms, and integrate Western and Hmong practices.

Attending to Diversity in Group Psychotherapy: An Ethical Imperative,"Ethical issues can arise in dealing with diversity when practicing group psychotherapy. In this paper, a case is presented of a therapist-in-training who is attempting to determine whether a particular psychotherapy group composed exclusively of heterosexual males would be an appropriate and effective treatment venue for a gay male; the clinical vignette is designed to illustrate a process of ethical and culturally competent decision making. The discussion of this vignette articulates the multiple steps through which the group psychotherapist must proceed to successfully resolve ethical dilemmas that are related to diversity.

"Eating disorders, culture, and ethnicity: Connections and challenges in group therapy","Group therapy appears to be an effective treatment modality for individuals with eating disorders, which are known to occur in women from diverse racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds. Differences in symptom presentation and a decreased likelihood of accessing treatment have been documented in ethnic minority women with eating disorders. A number of culturally specific issues should be considered when treating diverse women with eating disorders in the group therapy context. Among others, consideration of cultural differences in ideal body size and shape, spirituality, the role of the family, and separation-individuation may be important areas of therapeutic work in group therapy.

Does ethnicity explain functioning in group counseling? The case of Arab and Jewish counseling trainees in Israel,"This study compared the functioning in group counseling of two ethnic groups--Arab and Jews in Israel. All participants were counseling trainees in a university program, led by one group leader. Variables included self-disclosure, goals for therapy, client behavior, and therapeutic factors, measured repeatedly (at least twice), either through questionnaires or through analyses of transcribed sessions. Statistical analyses were performed by means of a hierarchical model (mixed), with the individual nested within the small group and the ethnic cohort. In contrast to our expectations, results indicated more similarities than differences between the two cohorts. Moreover, Arab trainees intended to disclose more in group and actually did (based on a questionnaire) compared with their Jewish counterparts. On the Client Behavior Scale (C. E. Hill &amp; K. O'Brien, 1999) there were a few differences revealed: Arab trainees displayed more simple responses, more cognitive exploration, and less resistance, insight, and therapeutic change. Two differences were revealed also on the therapeutic factors. The discussion cautions against unnecessary modifications made in interventions with different cultural groups in counseling.

Group Psychotherapy for People With Intellectual Disabilities: The Interactive-Behavioral Model,"The authors describe a model of psychotherapy designed to treat people who have intellectual disabilities in addition to psychiatric disorders. The model, termed interactive-behavioral therapy, represents a modification of standard techniques from group psychotherapy and psychodrama. The authors briefly review the historical context in which the treatment model evolved and establish the need for effective therapeutic intervention for this population of dually diagnosed individuals. They also present preliminary efficacy research on the model.

An Experience of Group Work with Parents of Children and Adolescents with Gender Identity Disorder,"This article gives an account of an experience of group work with parents and carers who had children or adolescents with gender identity disorder (GID). The history of this intervention within the context of a service for children with gender identity problems is outlined. The limited literature on the subject is reviewed. Group meetings were held monthly for 6 months, facilitated by two therapists (the authors). Selection criteria for group participants, the aims of the group and the methodology for achieving those aims are described. Some information about the group's composition is provided. The structure and content of the group sessions are outlined together with details of some group interactions. Finally, we present the results of an evaluation of the intervention through feedback questionnaires and discuss the value for the children and young people of running such groups.

Group Counseling and Psychotherapy Across the Cultural Divide: The Case of Ethiopian Jewish Immigrants in Israel,"Effective counseling across a cultural divide depends on adaptations or changes of technique to suit the particular intercultural circumstances. The concept of mutual creative space provides a guiding principle for therapists who wish to make such changes. This space is 'negotiated' between the therapist/counselor coming from the 'dominant/mainstream' group within society, and the group participants who arrive from another culture. Mutual creative space consists of the negotiation of power and a process of mutual invention, incorporating the creation, by therapist and participants, of something new that did not exist in either of their cultures of origin. A meaningful encounter and effective group counseling can take place following the negotiation of such a creative space. This is illustrated by the example of intercultural group work with Ethiopian Jewish immigrants in Israel, including an analysis of cultural characteristics of the Ethiopian group and specific ways of negotiating mutual creative space in this case. Issues discussed include: establishing trust in the cross cultural context; the use of body language and its interpretation; the psychologist as an authority figure; active participation vs. hidden learning; and working with dreams in such groups.

Responses of Female Fire-Setters with Mild and Borderline Intellectual Disabilities to a Group Intervention,"Background: This report describes a cognitive behavioural group intervention for women with mild and borderline intellectual disabilities detained in a secure hospital setting because of their fire-setting behaviour. The study aimed to examine participants' motivations for setting fires, their responses to an intervention designed specifically for this group and to monitor their progress over an extended follow-up period. Methods: A number of fire-specific and clinical assessments were administered before the intervention started and immediately after it concluded to examine trends in the group data. Detailed case study material was collected in order to describe participants' engagement in and reactions to the treatment process, and their status at 2-year follow-up. Results: The intervention successfully engaged participants in the therapy process, all of whom completed the programme. Scores on measures related to fire-related treatment targets and clinical measures pertinent to motivations for fire-setting generally improved following the intervention. There were no reports of participants setting any fires 2 years after the intervention programme was completed. Conclusions: The group intervention appeared to be acceptable and beneficial to study participants. This pilot study needs to be extended into a more robust evaluation of this approach with this group.

Men in groups: Insights and interventions,"The preponderance of the patients in United States substance abuse treatment are men while the majority of the caregivers are women. The current system of treating men is flawed by the approach typically taken. This paper presents an approach to treating male substance abusers in group. Its hypothesis is that men do better in treatment in gender-specific groups, where a variety of methodologies are employed. It also proposes that, given the majority of female counselors in the field, gender-sensitive training is appropriate for all counselors, especially female therapists.

Factors associated with the efficacy of a group intervention for anger in people with intellectual disabilities,"Objectives: There is a growing literature that suggests cognitive behavioural interventions aimed at reducing inappropriately expressed anger by people with intellectual disabilities are effective. However, interventions provide little information about which aspects of the individual or their treatment may be contributing to the overall efficacy of the approach. Design: A group intervention is compared with a waiting list control. A cross-sectional regressional method was used to explore the relationship between change in a provocation inventory score over the course of an intervention and a number of other variables. Methods: Data was collected from 50 participants who attended a series of groups with the aim of reducing aggressive behaviour. This was compared with a waiting list control of 36. Outcome was measured by a provocation inventory, which was administered pre-, post-group, and at follow-up. Other variables were also measured including, receptive vocabulary, age, gender, experience of primary therapist and whether staff accompanied participants to the group or not. Results: A 2 × 2 split plot ANOVA identified a statistically significant treatment effect. However, analysis examining clinical significance was more equivocal with only 11 of the individuals in the intervention group showing reliable change as defined by Jacobson and Truax (1991). Regression analysis indicated that 17.5% of the variance in change of provocation inventory scores could be accounted for by the independent variables. Immediately on completion of the group, being accompanied by a member of staff and increased receptive language scores contributed significantly to the variance. Conclusions: A reduction in provocation inventory scores immediately after the group was more likely to occur if the participant was accompanied by a member of staff who knew them and if they had a higher score on the test of receptive vocabulary. This pattern changed with time. The implications of the results will be discussed and the relatively large amount of variance that is not accounted for will also be considered.

The Anger Management Project: A group intervention for anger in people with physical and multiple disabilities,"Background: This paper describes the evaluation of a group program designed specifically to meet the anger management needs of a group of individuals with various levels of intellectual disability and/or complex communication needs. Method: Twenty-nine individuals were randomly assigned to an intervention group or a waiting-list comparison group. The intervention comprised a 12-week anger management program, based on Novaco's (1975) cognitive-behavioural conceptualisation of anger, which incorporates adapted content and pictographic materials developed for clients with a range of disabilities. Results: On completion of the program, clients from the intervention group had made significant improvements in their self-reported anger levels, compared with clients from the comparison group, and relative to their own pre-intervention scores. Treatment effects were maintained at 4-month follow-up. In contrast, there was an absence of measured improvements in quality of life. Conclusions: The results provide evidence for the program's effectiveness as an intervention for anger problems for individuals with a range of disabilities.

Group psychotherapy with latinas: A cross-cultural and interactional approach,"Consideration of alternative approaches to traditional group psychotherapy is critical when working with women who are not from mainstream American society. An alternative short-term group psychotherapy model with Latinas is provided that incorporates both an interactional and a cross-cultural approach. The cultural contextual variable of marianismo is described and addressed as the most important element of the therapy process. Key themes significant to Latinas, such as depression, significant relationships, empowerment, assertiveness, work/career conflicts, sexuality, social network supports, and celebration rituals, are discussed.

Group Dynamics in the Treatment of People with Intellectual Disabilities: Optimizing Therapeutic Gain,"Group psychotherapy is an effective treatment modality for psychological disorders in the general population. Growing interest in the mental health treatment of people with intellectual disabilities and psychological disorders suggests that group psychotherapy is similarly beneficial for this population. Clinical training programs, however, typically provide only limited training in group therapy techniques. This article describes the utility of group psychotherapy for individuals with intellectual disabilities and common forms of psychopathology, and details specific recommendations for treatment in an effort to add to the clinical expertise of treatment providers.

Enhancing Self-Esteem in Women With Physical Disabilities,"Objective: To determine the efficacy of a 6-week self-esteem group intervention for women with disabilities. Design: Random assignment to either center for independent living (CIL) services or CIL services plus a self-esteem intervention, with pre- and posttest. Participants: Women with physical disabilities (N=102, 51 per group). Setting: Five CILs in 5 different states. Outcome measures: Self-esteem, self-efficacy, social connectedness, and depression. Results: Participants in the intervention group showed significantly greater improvement on self-esteem (effect sizes [ES]=.88 and .81), self-efficacy (ES=.60), and depression (ES=.59). Groups did not differ significantly on social connectedness (ES=.32). Conclusion: Women with physical disabilities may benefit from a self-esteem group intervention.

"""I'm not the only one!"" Group therapy with older children and adolescents who have learning disabilities","Children and adolescents with learning disabilities (LD) are vulnerable to psychosocial difficulties. Both the detrimental impact of LD on social adjustment and the significance of peer relations for developmental needs make group therapy a natural intervention. Despite modifications that are required due to their cognitive deficits, many students with LD fit the criteria and can benefit from group psychotherapy. In this paper, a model of group therapy for older children and adolescents with LD is presented. The approach is informed by a combination of self psychology, mutual aid, and interpersonal group therapy. The leaders use special techniques to accommodate the LD and to foster the group process. Examples are presented to illustrate the approach.

Evaluation of a Group Intervention to Assist Aging Parents with Permanency Planning for an Adult Offspring with Special Needs,"More than three-fourths of older adults with developmental disabilities and mental illness live in the community with aging parents, the majority of whom do not complete plans for the residential, financial, and legal future of their offspring. The authors used a true experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of a six-week psychoeducational group intervention with 27 older mothers. Data collected in pre- and posttest telephone interviews were analyzed with repeated measures MANCOVA to test five hypotheses. Significant multivariate effects were found for mothers' knowledge and awareness about permanency planning, confidence and competence to plan, planning activities, and stage of planning. Findings support use of group interventions with older parents and underscore the need for professional education about planning for adults with special needs.

Differences in Men's and Women's Responses to Short-Term Group Psychotherapy,"The authors examined the role of patient gender in the process and outcome of 2 forms of short-term group psychotherapy: interpretive and supportive. The sample consisted of depressed outpatients who were also experiencing complicated grief after a variety of death losses. Findings indicated that women generally had better outcomes in both forms of group therapy compared with men. In addition, men were less committed to their therapy groups than women and were perceived by other group members to be less compatible than women. This suggests that men may derive less benefit from group psychotherapy than women. This gender effect may be partially mediated by men's lack of commitment to the group and perceived incompatibility with other group members.

The Gender-Ambivalent Group and the Gender-Blinded Analyst,"Group therapists must pay careful attention to gender-related issues appearing in groups. While this may appear obvious, in practice there is often a reluctance to do so. This is in part owing to the fact that exploring gender-related differences may threaten group harmony. The present article shows first how this ambivalence is reflected historically in the group therapy literature. It then brings case examples of group sessions which demonstrate such ambivalence. Reasons for the ambivalence are offered in the discussion section. It is suggested that while open exploration of gender tension may lead to acrimony or embarrassment, ultimately the group learns it can contain these feelings, survive and in fact achieve a more solid and lasting cohesion.

Grief counseling groups in a medium-security prison,"The authors discuss their facilitation of four grief counseling groups with male inmates in a state prison over a two-year period. Warden's Tasks of Mourning were used as a guide for the group process. Disenfranchised grief and gender and cultural issues in grieving are explored. Catalytic exercises are described, and written feedback from inmates is included. The authors also describe the impact these experiences had on themselves as counselors and facilitators of the groups.

Multicultural-Multilingual Group Sessions Development of Functional Communication,"Group therapy with multilingual, multicultural populations is a challenging and unexplored area that is beginning to be addressed because of the growing population of multilingual, multicultural children. In this article, the importance of working with children from different cultural backgrounds, and current research on bilingualism are reviewed. Along with that information, a program that was created to work with Spanish and bilingual Spanish-English preschool and kindergarten age children is presented. This program focused primarily on the process for developing a thematic bilingual language-based curriculum for young children who exhibit a communicative disorder. Group therapy was targeted as part of the holistic approach that consisted of working on sentence structure activities, and communication boards that could be used both in individual or group sessions. Parent involvement was made possible with weekly homework letters and games. This curriculum will expand on a method of collaboration between a special education teacher and a speech-language pathologist for the development of communication skills in young children. The language group was conducted within a naturalistic context and/or the classroom environment.

The Effects of Reality Therapy Group Counseling on the Self- Determination of Persons with Developmental Disabilities,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of group counseling employing a reality therapy or a mutual support group model on the self-determination of adults with developmental disabilities. A two-group, pretest/posttest design was utilized. Participants (n=30) were randomly assigned to either the reality therapy group or the mutual support group. The group counseling consisted of six, one-hour, sessions using methodologies created for this study. Results indicated a statistically significant difference for the reality therapy group when compared to the mutual support group at posttest. Statistically significant increases were observed within the reality therapy group from pretest to posttest. This study provides partial evidence that group counseling using a reality therapy framework can be helpful in increasing some factors associated with self-determination for persons with developmental disabilities.

Breaking Through the Despair: Spiritually Oriented Group Therapy As a Means of Healing Women with Severe Mental Illness,"Studies have shown that 96% of Americans believe in God and over 90% pray yet there is relatively little education available for clinicians on how to use spirituality as a tool for healing mental illness, particularly when treating very sick patients. This article illustrates how spiritually oriented group therapy with severely ill women can help to improve mood, affect, motivation, interpersonal bonding, and sense of self, and can succeed in reaching patients and promoting recovery in ways that traditional therapy cannot. Specific modalities including group prayer, yoga breathing, and spiritual readings are described. Breaking Through the Despair offers both a psychodynamic and a neurophysiologic perspective for understanding how this type of treatment helps patients transcend their mental illness and be able to grasp abstract spiritual concepts, develop a sense of belonging to a caring community, and integrate a new sense of themselves as productive and valued individuals.

The case report considered the feasibility of delivering a group intervention comprised of cardiovascular activities and weight training in a community recreation center when fitness areas were available and being used by the public. A second purpose was to report inclusion best practices that supported initial program implementation. After 11 weeks, comparison of fitness assessments from pre- to post-program on 11 participants noted positive and negative changes. Results suggested that a ""low-tech"" group fitness intervention protocol using reported inclusion best practices supported implementation of this program with community dwelling participants.

"An interview study of people with learning disabilities' experience of, and satisfaction with, group analytic therapy","A number of clinicians have developed psychodynamic treatments for people with learning disabilities, but there have been few studies assessing the impact of psychodynamic therapy with this population. In particular, there have been no studies in which investigators have asked clients about their experience of psychodynamic treatment. The current study is an attempt to rectify this by exploring people with learning disabilities' experiences of, and satisfaction with, two psychodynamic groups provided by an inner city service. Nine learning-disabled clients, four from a sexual offenders' group and five from a women's group, were interviewed about their experience of psychodynamic group psychotherapy. Their responses were analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Participants suggested that they valued the therapists and the group, and appreciated the opportunity to talk about painful experiences and be included and valued in the group. However, participants also indicated that they found the group emotionally painful, on occasion found it hard to identify with other group members, and were often unaware of any positive change in themselves. These interview findings complement ongoing quantitative attempts to establish the impact of psychodynamic treatment...

Clinical Application of the Gender Role Strain Paradigm: Group Treatment tor Adolescent Boys,"The aim of this article is to demonstrate the clinical application of the gender role strain paradigm with a group of adolescent boys. Adolescent boys experience overwhelming pressure to adhere to gender norms. As they attempt to conform to the expectations associated with the male role, boys suffer from gender role strain. We illustrate how the protective environment of the group enables boys to engage and discuss problems with male role norms. The shift in the boys' adherence to traditional notions of masculinity supports the utility of the gender role strain paradigm in clinical work.

Do People with Dementia Benefit from Psychological Interventions Offered on a Group Basis?,"Psychological interventions, whether directed at cognitive functioning or emotional expression, are frequently offered on a group basis to people with dementia. This paper aims to review the range of therapies offered and to evaluate the evidence for their effectiveness. Four categories of group therapy are identified: early approaches to enhancing well-being (reality orientation, validation and reminiscence); methods aimed at improving memory and cognition (cognitive stimulation and memory training); psychotherapy; and support. Although the review demonstrates the wide range of group work offered, and the creativity of practitioners in this area, relatively little formal evaluation has been undertaken. It is therefore difficult to reach firm conclusions regarding evidence for efficacy. There is a need for more research, and future evaluations should pay increased attention to the selection of appropriate methodologies and outcome measures, the question of clinical relevance and the issue of individual differences in response to intervention. In addition, it will be important to enable people with dementia and their family members to play a role in determining what interventions are relevant and acceptable, and what outcomes are desirable.

The impact of culture on group behavior: A comparison of three ethnic groups,"The purpose of this study was to compare behavior in group counseling of Moslem, Druze, and Jewish adolescents (ages 14-15 yrs) in Israel. On the basis of the literature, differences were expected between the three groups on all dimensions under investigation: self-disclosure, affiliation (response to self-disclosure), and gains. The Jewish adolescents were expected to show the highest rates of self-disclosure, affiliation, and gains; Moslems were expected to be next; and the Druze were expected to have the lowest rates. Contrary to expectations, the highest rates of self-disclosure were found for the Moslem adolescents; the lowest rates were indeed for Druze. In affiliation and gains, differences were minimal.

"Migration, identity and group analysis","Discusses the use of group analysis by migrants to adapt to their new environment. Migrants from one country to another may experience a profound disturbance of their individual, social, and cultural identities. A group-analytic psychotherapy group provides a microcosm of the adopted culture. Membership of such a group may enable immigrants to develop a sense of belonging to the group and thus to resolve, or resolve again, their crises of ""identity vs. identity confusion"" in the new culture. Through the processes of identification, belonging, and learning to share the language of the group, a sense of intimacy with others may be achieved.

The TAFES multi-family group intervention for Kosovar refugees: A feasibility study,"Describes a feasibility study of the Tea and Families Education and Support (TAFES) intervention used in a group of 86 newly resettled refugees (aged 17-66 yrs) from Kosova in Chicago. The subjects (Ss) gave informed consent to participate in an investigation of the TAFES intervention. All Ss received family home visits, and most participated in the TAFES multi-family groups. The instruments were administered to adult participants before and 3 mo after the intervention. The TAFES program had contact with 61 Kosovar refugee families, of which 42 families (69%) engaged in TAFES groups, including families with educated and working members. Characteristics associated with engaging in TAFES groups included lower monthly family income and higher age of the first child. The uncontrolled postintervention assessments demonstrated increases in social support and psychiatric service use associated with engagement in the TAFES group. Participants also showed time changes in scale scores assessing trauma mental health knowledge, trauma mental health attitudes, and family hardiness. This study provides preliminary evidence that multi-family support and education groups are a feasible and possibly beneficial intervention for newly resettled refugees and indicates the need for further studies.

Implementation and process issues in using Group Triple P with Chinese parents: Preliminary findings,"The aim of this study was to implement and evaluate a Triple P-Positive Parenting Program Level 4 (Group) intervention with Chinese parents. Forty five Cantonese-speaking parents living in Sydney participated in five groups conducted over a 12-month period. Implementation aspects included promoting the service to the Chinese community, using an appropriately trained bilingual facilitator, and modifying the process of conducting groups to suit Cantonese-speaking parents. The intervention involved four group sessions followed by four optional brief weekly telephone consultation sessions. Parents were asked to complete the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 2001) before and after the intervention. There were significant improvements on the Prosocial Behaviour Score. Parents also completed an abbreviated version of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (Turner, Markie-Dadds &amp; Sanders, 1998) which showed parents were satisfied with the program, most particularly in relation to receiving the help they required and being helped to deal with their child's behaviour. Given the unwillingness of some parents to complete questionnaires, the difficulties encountered in conducting evaluation in cross-cultural contexts are discussed, along with recommendations for multiple methods in future research.

"Creative use of gender while addressing early attachment, trauma, and cross-cultural issues in a cotherapy group","This paper examines how early attachments, trauma, and transference are modified by cross-cultural issues in a group therapy setting. The paper focuses on preparation of an appropriate group after individual treatment, attention to composition in that group, and use of a female-male cotherapist team in helping two Latin American female group members work through their early traumas. In addition, the paper speaks about times when individual treatment with the group therapist of the opposite sex should be added. The paper emphasizes and clarifies how not to get caught up in cultural stereotypes and how the clinician needs to stay with the specificity of the person's organizing experiences.

Integrating spirituality and domestic violence treatment: Treatment of Aboriginal men,"This article provides a brief reflection on how the Change of Seasons treatment model developed and the reasons for its success with Aboriginal men. Parallels between Aboriginal perspectives, or worldviews, and Ken Wilber's transpersonal psychology, Rupert Sheldrake's fields theory, and Peter Senge's systems thinking are also discussed. Practical rituals and ceremonies that have been successfully integrated into psycho-educational group counselling as practiced in the Change of Seasons model are explained. These musings are included to initiate further dialogue on holistic approaches to counselling and other community initiatives.

The effect of group intervention on the relationships of parents with intellectual disabilities,"Background: Parents with intellectual disabilities frequently feel socially excluded and often become dependent on statutory agencies for support. This study aimed to tackle these difficulties by means of a group intervention. Methods: Group intervention was provided to 12 parents with borderline or mild intellectual disabilities over 14 weeks. The effects of intervention were evaluated by comparing the intervention group with a borderline or mild intellectual disabilities control parent group (n=10). Both experimental parent group (EPG) and control parent group (CPG) received home-based teaching programmes during this period. Parents' self-concept and perception of the quality of relationship with their children, partners, family members and professionals were assessed (Judson Rating Scale and Behaviour Problem Index) during baseline, post-intervention and at 27-week follow-up. Results: The results indicate that self-concept improved significantly for the EPG with no observable gains made by the CPG. However, the 'feel good factor' which came from improvements in parents' self-concept did not immediately benefit their children...

Reviewing current literature on women, gender and groups, the author discusses the absence of discussion of the erotic (including the homoerotic) within groups including women's groups and how this connects with questions of agency, power and knowledge. The gendering of power and authority and its reflections within group processes is also considered. Two contrasting representations emerging from the group material, the ""experienced lesbian"" and the ""murderous doctor"", are then analyzed as indicative of the range of available transferential positions in which the (woman) group conductor can be located. It is argued, first, that such broader consideration of women's positions within group processes promotes exploration of the multiple and diverse forms of sexed/gendered relations within groups. Second, that these relations may transcend actual sex gendered positions, whereby, third, attending to such gendered power dynamics accords with group analysis as an arena connecting individual, familial and broader cultural relations.

Talking gender in the group,"Research into the relationship between language and gender challenges group psychotherapy to pay attention to the significance of gender in shaping the language used by members and conductors. Language is a major resource in the creation of our gendered sense of self, with styles stereotypically associated with male and female. The linguistic culture of the group has stereotypical ""male"" and ""female"" aspects. The language of the therapist is critical in establishing linguistic norms, challenging or reinforcing gender stereotypes. The movement from these stereotypical styles, with the ability to draw upon both ""male"" and ""female"" characteristics, is a therapeutic movement. The absence of critical analysis of these aspects of language and gender in group theory witnesses to the power of the ""social unconscious"".

"Remaking connections: Refugees and the development of ""emotional capital"" in therapy groups","This article describes a form of ongoing specialized psychoanalytic group therapy that addresses the psychological issues that can impede the individual's integration into a new country. The concept of ""emotional capital"" is introduced as a way of summarizing those internal capacities we see as fundamental to the individual's capacity to make use of what Putnam (2000) has termed ""social capital"". Asylum-seekers from several countries with only extremely limited English in common are seen together in an ongoing therapy group, where they may remain for over a year, before they are ready (emotionally and linguistically) to join a heterogeneous psychoanalytic psychotherapy group within the same Department. Provides case examples of three individuals ages 26-41 yrs. Clinical material is presented from the two settings: the Refugees' group, to illustrate the first steps in the rebuilding of a capacity to make emotional connections and the later Analytic Therapy group where refugees' earlier developmental difficulties can be addressed within the new social context.

Cultural identity and groups of belonging,"The author argues that research into the cultural foundations of psychic structure must take place simultaneously at the individual, group, and psychosocial level of analysis. Identity, as both an individual and a collective phenomenon, and the primacy of the group dimension become manifest in the imaginary space created by groups, in W. Bion's ""protomental system."" Cultural ""incorporates"" function like somatic processes and establish the synchrony of all cultural interactions. Individuation would thus emerge from the shared common base, which in turn is related to the individual's internalization of his ""group of belonging."" A distinction is drawn between primary groups of belonging, which are extensions of family structure and supply the group's cultural identity, and secondary belonging groups, which are ""instituted"" by the society. The relationship between transcultural experiences, aiming at achieving unity, and intercultural experiences, which recognize limits and differences, is a source of tension for the individual and the group. Examples are given of the function of excitation ""screens"" within instituted groups and of the cultural dimension of the analytic setting.

Introduction to the special edition: The implications of multicultural diversity and ethnopolitical conflict for working with groups,"This special edition introduction explores the reasons that social and political forces and traumatic societal events have been neglected in the theory and practice of group psychotherapy. Freud's abandonment of the infantile seduction theory and subsequent emphasis on intrapsychic fantasy and defense, the philosophy and science of the Enlightenment, and professional norms in a field dominated by individuals from ""privileged"" classes and cultures are cited as sources of the relative neglect of ethnopolitical conflict, minority issues, and multicultural diversity in the treatment process. The articles in this journal attempt to redress these shortcomings and constitute a movement towards including these factors in the common ""standard"" of training and treatment.

A gender-specific HIV/STD risk reduction intervention for women in a health care setting: Short- and long-term results of a randomized clinical trial,"Assessed the short- and long-term effect of a gender-specific group intervention for women on unsafe sexual encounters and strategies for protection against HIV/STD infection. Family planning clients ( N =360) from a high HIV seroprevalence area in New York City were randomized to an 8-session, a 4-session or a control condition and followed at 1, 6 and 12 mo post-intervention. Using an intention-to-treat analysis, women who were assigned to the 8-session group had about twice the odds of reporting decreased or no unprotected vaginal and anal intercourse compared to controls at 1 mo and at 12-mo follow-up. Relative to controls, women assigned to the 8-session condition reported during the previous month approximately 3-and-a-half and 5 fewer unprotected sex occasions at 1- and 12-mo follow-up, respectively. Women in the 8-session group also reduced the number of sex occasions at both follow-ups, and had a greater odds of 1st time use of an alternative protective strategy (refusal, outercourse, mutual testing) at 1-mo follow-up. Results for the 4-session group were in the expected direction but overall were inconclusive.

Women in group and women's groups,"Female development is characterized by the introjection of maternal and paternal objects, which creates a rich internal world for women. However, the feminine tendency to become diffused in identifications sometimes results in women feeling overpowered in mixed-gender groups. The author advocates women's groups for the traditionally ""feminine"" woman, that is, the woman who has a rather impoverished sense of self in terms of her internalized objects. Women's groups are also helpful during adolescence, pregnancy, and menopause, milestones of female development. These are times when women are in profound crisis and may find it difficult to speak about these quintessentially feminine events in the presence of men.

Use of Group Counseling to Support Aging-Related Losses in Older Adults with Intellectual Disabilities,"With the noted increase in life expectancy of persons with intellectual disabilities (ID), there is a need to provide more physical and psychological preparation for aging and support for these individuals in their middle-age and aging periods of life. It is known that age-related losses result in major stressors and that these can produce changes in the way that older adults think, feel or act. Therefore, having methods and tools to help individuals with ID prepare for and adjust to their losses is important. To address this, the Neve Natoa Residential Center in Israel initiated a group intervention program to test whether a group counseling method could be used to help prepare adults for changes associated with aging. Nine adults (5 males and 4 females) between the ages of 39 and 56 (mean = 49) participated in the program pilot. After ten sessions, an evaluation indicated a positive change of attitudes, improvement of self-esteem, and less extreme behavioral reactions in the period after the intervention. Given the positive results, it is recommended that further studies involving group intervention techniques with adults with ID be undertaken.

Group psychotherapists: Professional and cultural differences,"Explored the differences in the practice of group therapy between psychiatrists and psychologists and between the 2 cultural regions of Switzerland (which would influence their cultural heritage, i.e., Germanic or Latin). Psychiatrists and psychologist have different training and forms of professional activity and so might also differ in their practice of group activities and theoretical orientations. A questionnaire was sent to 533 Swiss psychiatrists and psychologists(mean age 44 yrs). Two-thirds of these therapists live in the German-speaking region and one-third in the French- or Italian-speaking region. The overall results show that there exists a basic practice and common theoretical reference in both professions and in the cultural regions of Switzerland. The groups that these therapists are handling are mainly small, made up of adults, with diagnoses of depressive, anxiety or personality disorders, and often take place in psychiatric institutions. Regarding their principal theoretical orientation, group therapists first mention a psychodynamic approach, then systemic and cognitive-behavioral orientations. Beyond this set of features which are common to both professions and both regions, the main differences appear between psychiatrists and psychologists.

Providing mental health services to Southeast Asian adolescent girls: Integration of a primary prevention paradigm and group counseling,"Few writers have discussed the specific mental health needs of Southeast Asian adolescent girls. In this article, the authors present an intervention for Southeast Asian adolescent girls using a primary prevention paradigm within a culturally relevant framework consisting of (a) alcohol, tobacco, and other drug prevention; (b) tutoring; (c) cultural heritage classes; and (d) group counseling. The group intervention was implemented as an after-school program and included 15 females aged 11–15 yrs. Group counseling served as a catalyst to discuss issues raised from the other components of the intervention and provided an opportunity for participants to discuss personal, social, and academic concerns. The 4 goals were to facilitate (a) growth regarding self-acceptance, (b) learning strategies to cope with issues related to cultural identity, (c) a sense of trust among fellow group members, and (d) the application of what is learned in the group to everyday situations. Three implications are discussed: providing training on cultural and gender issues for facilitators, understanding cultural identity interaction theory, and using bilingual group leaders.

Culture and the practice of group psychotherapy in Singapore,"Trained in S. H. Foulkes' group analysis (Foulkes, 1965) in London, the author, born and bred in Singapore, conducted a slow-open, multiracial psychotherapy group in the English language for neurotic patients in Singapore over an 8-year period. 30 patients attended the group with an average attendance duration of 3 years. The majority had a favorable outcome with improved symptoms, interpersonal relationships, and ability at work. This article identifies a number of unique, culture-specific group processes in the following areas: authority, individuation, and intimacy. The relevance of Western group psychotherapy to Oriental culture will be also examined in light of the above group being the first, psychodynamic group-analytic group in Singapore.

TEAM BROTHERS: An Africentric approach to group work with African American male adolescents,"This article describes a group counseling intervention for urban, elementary school age African American boys. TEAM BROTHERS is a multicultural prevention approach using the Nguzo Saba (Swahili word denoting the seven principles of Kwanzaa) to facilitate group interaction and change via Africentric content and process and positive reinforcement. The principal goal is to empower young African American boys to succeed through knowledge of self and cultural heritage. The authors provide a brief description of group process and content to illustrate how a group counselor might implement this multicultural prevention approach in a school setting. Results suggest that the approach had a positive impact on participants' in-school attitudes and behaviors.

"A psychotherapy group as a sociopolitical context: The case of the ""silent majority""","Group psychotherapy can be conceived as a sociopolitical context, wherein participants (as citizens) struggle to balance personal needs and rights against the collective requirements of the group to which they belong. Potential conflicts arise between: (1) a member's right to privacy and the group's need to know about its members; and (2) the will of the majority and the protection of the minority. Psychotherapeutic groups also face constituency problems that arise from inequality of opportunity, skills or feelings of self-worth that affect what members give and get. This article explores the relationship between individual and group needs, membership and leadership, and the evolution of an enabling group culture in the case of the ""silent majority'.

Childhood sexual abuse. An evaluation of a two-year group therapy in adult women,"22 female psychiatric outpatients (aged 20–54 yrs) with experiences of childhood sexual abuse took part in a 2-yr group therapy based on psychodynamic theory. At the end of therapy the women's psychiatric symptoms were reduced on the Symptom Checklist and the Global Severity Index, with a correlation between severity of symptoms and age of abuse onset. 95% of patients were satisfied with the group therapy and would recommend it to a friend. 86% reported an improved ability to identify positive and negative feelings, and a large (68%) or moderate (27%) improvement in self-esteem. 73% reported improved relationships to their partners, 83% to own children, and 73% to friends, and communication and sexual problems were reduced. While improvements were observed at the end of the group therapy, most women needed additional individual therapy.

Group procedures and applications for developing sociocultural competencies among immigrants,"Argues that the preferred training model for developing effective ways of helping immigrants develop behavioral competencies and self-confidence in the new culture is one that utilizes role-based learning in groups and incorporates aspects of group counseling theory and practice. Effective facilitators of these immigrant groups should be skilled group leaders competent in taking participants through the 4 stages involved in teaching each of several key sociocultural competencies: (1) alliance building, (2) cultural mapping, (3) coaching and practice, and (4) contract setting. Group leaders will need to perform particular types of task and maintenance functions, and facilitate the development of group inclusion, control, and trust. To achieve this, facilitators are recommended to use a range of micro skills for group leading, processing, and counseling.

Group interventions for anger in people with intellectual disabilities,"Describes an evaluation of a group intervention for reducing inappropriately expressed anger (as aggression) in people with intellectual disabilities. Group intervention was compared to a treatment as usual group consisting of people referred to the group but who had to wait to participate. The intervention used was based on the work of R. W. Novaco (1976; 1978) and B. Benson (1994). However, further modifications to the group that emphasized the contextual perspective of anger, such as the participants being accompanied by a support worker and more collaborative recording procedures, were devised. A reduction in expressed anger and measured levels of depression occurred after group treatment. Reductions in expressed anger were maintained at 6 and 12 months follow up. However, scores on the depression scale tended to increase on follow up. While caution must be expressed when considering these results, this type of intervention shows promise for reducing inappropriately expressed anger in people with intellectual disabilities.

Effectiveness of communication and relationship skills training for men in substance abuse treatment,"Although the importance of gender-sensitive programming for women has been acknowledged, few studies have examined outcomes from male-centered interventions in substance abuse treatment programs. Data were collected from 122 male clients (aged 17–57 yrs) in a court-mandated residential treatment program who participated in a study of a psychoeducational group intervention for men. The intervention (Time Out! For Men) addressed communication skills, sexuality, gender socialization, and intimacy. Participation in the training resulted in significant increases in knowledge and social conformity, along with reductions in attitudes that may be associated with rigid socialization and gender-role conflict. The results provide support for the utility of male-targeted programming in substance abuse treatment settings.

Utility of an African-centered support group for African American men confronting societal racism and oppression,"African American men suffer from the chronic stressor of living in a racist and oppressive society. This condition has historical roots dating back to enslavement and deportation from Africa to America. The psychological and physical difficulties that this group suffers from as a result of both the direct and the indirect influences of this chronic stressor have been well documented. However, a recent review of the literature revealed that not one article has been published in any of the major psychology journals that describes treatment issues or case studies focusing on this issue. This case study outlines the use of an African-centered group approach to helping African American men develop effective coping skills to successfully ameliorate the impact of societal racism and oppression on their lives.

Integrative treatment of undesirable behavior in children with learning difficulties,"Studied the usefulness of integrative group therapy in decreasing the frequency of undesirable forms of behavior in children with learning disabilities in Croatia. 13 children (9 boys, 4 girls; aged 7–11 yrs) divided into 3 groups according to age participated in 33 90-min sessions. Non-intellectual aspects of social competence were assessed using the Croatian version of the Adaptive Behavior Scale for Children and Adults (K. Nihira et al., 1974; revised by L. Ingric and R. Fulgosi-Masnjak, 1991). The following variables were evaluated: violent and destructive behavior, antisocial behavior, rebelliousness, doubtful behavior, withdrawal, odd mannerisms, inappropriate manners, unacceptable vocal habits, eccentric habits, self-abuse, hyperactivity, sexually aberrant behavior, psychological disturbances, and use of medications. After the experimental period, Ss showed a significant decrease in the frequency of undesirable forms of behavior (major changes in psychological disturbances).

Group work with women with learning disabilities,"The intention of this paper is to give an insight into the way in which group work offers women with learning disabilities the opportunity to (1) see what they have in common with other women and (2) enable them to develop a positive sense of themselves and their sexuality. The paper contains a summary of the author's role and the context in which this group work takes place. Descriptions of group recruitment, referral process, group criteria, group work practice, and methods are offered. The key themes which women with learning disabilities consistently raise within the groups are explored and examples are given to illustrate how the women's group responds to these. The paper concludes by listing some of the important factors which facilitators need to be mindful of when setting up groups for women with learning disabilities.

"A randomized, controlled trial of a behavioral intervention to prevent sexually transmitted disease among minority women","Studied the effects of culture- and sex-specific small-group interventions in preventing sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among 193 African-American and 424 Mexican-American females (aged 14–45 yrs). The intervention consisted of 3 small-group sessions of 3–4 hrs each, designed to help women recognize personal susceptibility, commit to changing their behavior, and acquire necessary skills. The control group received standard counseling about STDs. All women in the study had nonviral STDs. Rates of subsequent infection were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group during the 1st 6 mo (11.3 vs 17.2%), during the 2nd 6 mo (9.1 vs 17.7%), and over the entire 12-mo study period (16.8 vs 26.9%). Results suggest that risk reduction consisting of 3 small-group sessions significantly decreased rates of chlamydial and gonorrheal infection among Mexican-American and African-American women at high risk for STD.

"Aspects of intrapsychic, interpersonal and cross-cultural dynamics in Japanese group psychotherapy","Psychoanalytic psychotherapy is not well developed in Japan. Until recently, group psychotherapy in particular has not been well received by patients or clinicians. Cultural difficulties in using group psychotherapy with Japanese patients have now been overcome and a theory of systematic intervention techniques has been developed. The basic dynamic factors of group psychotherapy such as culturally embedded aspects of social and personality structure are analyzed in this article. Culture-bound psychodynamic characteristics of Japanese patients as activated and worked through in the group process are first described with case illustrations. A systemic hypothesis linking cultural and psychodynamic structure is then delineated and the focal points of interventions are explained in terms of the field dynamics of social structure and boundary dynamics of personality structure.

Splitting and projective identification in multicultural group counseling,"Discusses how splitting and projective identification underlie racial and cultural prejudice, demonstrates their dynamics in multicultural groups, and shows how identifying and working through these dynamics can serve the group purpose of ego strengthening and also decrease prejudice and promote community building. Three cognitive styles are discussed as predisposing to splitting and projective identification: authoritarian thinking, conformity, and ethnocentrism. The group process is seen as parallel to that of individuals as they move from splitting and projective identification (manifested in prejudice), to identification of split-off parts as a defense, to fuller self acceptance and acceptance of those on whom they had projected negative feelings. This group experience is viewed as a microcosm of reversing prejudice and racism in the larger society, and thus as a microcosm of community building.

Individual and group psychotherapy approaches for persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities,"Although the prevalence of mental illness among persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities (MR/DD) is well documented, most psychotherapists have not expanded their practices to include patients from this population. The majority of reports in the early literature documented that people with MR/DD could benefit from treatment, and reports from recent years continue to inspire optimism about the effectiveness of psychotherapy. This article discusses adaptations of standard psychotherapeutic techniques for persons with MR/DD including simplication, language, activities, developmental level, directive and flexible methods, involvement of caregivers, transference/countertransference, and disability/rehabilitation approaches. Essential elements of the psychotherapeutic process are outlined including content vs process, support vs skills training, action methods vs verbal methods, and therapeutic growth and group psychotherapy.

Goal-focused group psychotherapy (GFGP) utilized focused psychoeducation and skills training to assist each patient in the achievement of individualized goals, while reminiscence therapy (RT) emphasized individual life review to facilitate discussion. 13 Ss, aged 55+ yrs, with major depression were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 groups. While both treatment groups improved in depressed mood and disability, GFGP Ss had a far greater change in depressive symptomatology and also improved in the areas of hope, hopelessness, anxiety and social functioning.

Group therapy for boys with features of Asperger syndrome and concurrent learning disabilities: Finding a peer group,"This article presents a pilot group therapy model with modifications, for boys who meet the criteria of Asperger Syndrome as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV), and who have concurrent learning disabilities. It is recognized that learning disabilities are often a feature of Asperger Syndrome. Children and adolescents with learning disabilities are vulnerable to experiencing social and emotional problems, in particular difficulties with peers. The social functioning of children and adolescents who have Asperger Syndrome is greatly impeded, although they are motivated to have social contact and to make friends. This paper describes how elements of interpersonal group therapy were combined with modifications, which address the unique social and cognitive profiles of the boys in this group. Case examples are provided to illustrate the group model. The group members and their parents were interviewed after the group and 2 yrs later, to obtain their view of the group. Their responses are presented.

Non-traditional women's group,"Focuses on an intensive large group experience for women that addresses issues of female identity and the cultural constructs that contribute to women's basic experience of self. It includes a discussion of self-concept and the social constructionist theory of the social, emotional, and psychological processes of the development of an individual's view of herself and the world. The author contrasts aspects of traditional group psychotherapy leadership, which tends to perpetuate society's devaluation of the feminine, with the leadership style of this workshop. The use of story and metaphor and other techniques used to achieve the workshop goals—including narrative therapy, guided imagery, movement and dance, and ritual enactment—are also discussed.

"Ethnicity, culture, and group psychotherapy","Ethnicity and culture have great therapeutic import in the practice of group psychotherapy, especially given the increasing diversity of the population of North America, and this issue has not received appropriate recognition in the literature. In this paper these terms are defined, and the literature is reviewed. Ethnicity, culture, and psychopathology are discussed, focusing on treatment issues including transference, countertransference, resistance, group cohesion, group process, and multi-ethnic groups. The group therapist must be knowledgeable about ethnic and cultural issues in the lives of the group members in order to promote group cohesion and therapeutic effectiveness. The recognition and exploration of ethnic/cultural differences enhances the work of the group. Recommendations for treatment are discussed.

What to look for in groups: Helping trainees bcome more sensitive to multicultural issues,"Presents a multicultural adaptation of P. Hanson's (1969, 1972) original group process observation guidelines to help students and other trainees become more aware of multicultural issues in group work. Multicultural sensitizers are added to each of the following original process observation categories: participation, influence, decision-making procedures, task functions, maintenance functions, group atmosphere, membership, feelings, and norms. A system for processing and discussing these expanded observations in a fishbowl design is detailed. Experimentation with the multicultural sensitizers is encouraged in a variety of settings, including education, business and industry, and mental health.

"Observations of a short-term, coed, bilingual group therapy for latency-age, Spanish-speaking immigrant children","This paper explores a short-term group therapy for school-aged children. The groups cater to troubled immigrant children, and attempt to help the children in their adjustment to the biculturation process. In the investigation, the peer culture and individual processes nurtured within the groups are examined through observation and drawing evaluations. It was found that the drawings and comments to the drawings were valuable tools to elicit the children's feelings and reactions to the group. In the end, it was felt that the bilingual feature of the group and group format, itself were helpful to the children, and that the coed and short-term aspects of the group were less helpful to the children.

Cultural psychotherapy: A consideration of psychosocial class and cultural differences in group treatment,"Most psychotherapists are aware of the many social issues and cultural factors that influence development throughout each individual life. Human nature, being a social nature, exists within relationships to others, the community, and a culture, sometimes a mixture of cultures. One social parameter, social class, redefined here as psychosocial class, has not received the same attention from psychotherapists as gender issues or ethnicity, two other important sociocultural spheres of influence on everyday life. It is suggested that group therapists are in a unique position to develop a cultural psychotherapy that addresses psychosocial class and cultural aspects of mental health. This paper includes a preliminary model of cultural psychotherapy that highlights the psychology of social class and culture for psychodynamic group psychotherapy.

The effects of small group counseling on the racial attitudes of second grade students,"Presents the results of small group counseling sessions designed to improve racial relations among 2nd grade students. The group was conducted in an effort to increase selected students' sensitivity to students of other racial groups and to promote more positive behavior among students of various racial groups. Five male students of different races were referred to this group by their teacher who had observed that these students had a tendency to be overly sensitive to any comments or material related to race. They had difficulty getting along with peers of a different race, and they did not appear to have skills necessary to interact socially with peers of another race. The goals of the group were to help these children look at their ""total behavior"" (actions, thoughts, feelings, and physiology), allow them the opportunity to evaluate their present behavior, and make them aware of alternate behaviors for social interaction. According to the results of the racial relations survey and the counselor's perceptions of the students' behavior. A change in racial attitudes was noted after the students participated in a series of small group counseling sessions.

Sarajevo-Israel—one way: Working with ex-Jugoslav adolescents in Israel,"In 1992, 20 young refugees, aged 15-16 yrs from Sarajevo, Bosnia, were absorbed at Nachlat Yehuda Youth Village in Israel under the auspices of Youth Aliyah. This paper describes a project carried out over a period of 6 mo with this group. It involves in-depth interviews and group therapy by a clinical psychologist who has worked for a number of years at the Oasis Center for Counselling for Refugees in Copenhagen, Denmark. The uncertainties about the reasons for sudden flight, feelings of abandonment, and constant fears for the lives of family members still in Bosnia are described. Because of unreal expectations about the destination, an easily aroused feeling of distrust toward adults was often present, together with feelings either of powerlessness or alternatively omnipotence, leading to a situation of ""pseudo-maturity."" Another problematic aspect was that of identity. Many of the group were from mixed Jewish, Muslim, or Christian families, with no previous knowledge about Israel, and deep uncertainties about considering Israel as a home or homeland.

Group psychotherapy with immigrants from Turkey,"Describes the psychodynamics and psychopathological aspects of Turkish immigrants in Switzerland who were members of psychotherapy groups. A group of 29 men (aged 29–58 yrs) and a group of 28 women (aged 24–47 yrs) were treated between 1991 and 1994. All of the patients were either depressive with other psychosomatic symptoms or suffered from a fibrositis syndrome. It is noted that Turkish patients often show basic resistance to change from collective living characteristic of their culture to individual-centred living and, consequently, an unwillingness or inability to adapt to the habits of new surroundings. Over time, the therapy groups became a substitute embodiment of the former family and community. The co-presence of equally concerned people gave the patients the courage to continue beyond the regressive phase and learn more adaptive behavior without feelings of guilt or shame from loyalty conflicts.

The introduction of role-play to a group of women with learning disabilities: Graded stages in developing role-play skills and some practical hints for facilitating role-play,"Describes the experiences of introducing role-play in the context of a women's group aimed at developing assertiveness around appropriate and inappropriate touch. The aim of the group was to provide the women with skills they would be able to generalize to everyday situations. Five females (aged 23–55 yrs) with mild to moderate learning disabilities completed 10 sessions in which the 6 graded stages in developing role-play skills are used. The Ss role-play skills developed to a more sophisticated level than they had in other groups where this approach had not be used. The Ss appeared more confident as they progressed through the 6 stages. Practical hints for trouble shooting are given.

Finding their voice: Group therapy for adolescents with learning disabilities,"A qualitative study was utilized to articulate the therapeutic elements and describe the ways they were operative in psychodynamic group therapy for adolescents with learning disabilities (LD) and related psychosocial problems. Four boys and 4 girls diagnosed with LD were interviewed upon completion of group therapy to obtain their perspectives of the group. Two important trends emerged. First, the important elements were identified, described, and grouped into 3 categories. Second, a phenomenon was identified, through which the therapeutic elements were operative by means of an interpersonal process. This interpersonal process was labeled mutual recognition, described as the adolescents realizing that they saw themselves in the others and that the others saw themselves in the participants. The therapeutic elements were trust, connection, and group process. These categories contributed to, and were influenced by, mutual recognition. The implications for clinical practice and research are discussed.

Paranoia in an ethnically-diverse population: The role of group work,"Examines basic elements of milieu therapy and applies them to work with the chronically mentally ill in addressing issues of cultural and racial diversity. Examples of both problematic and successful interventions in groups designed to promote personal and intercultural understanding are presented. The fine line between racism and paranoia, as experienced by mentally ill patients from ethnic minorities, is discussed. The need for a strong, active leader who can deal with many different cultures within the same group while maintaining impartiality and professionalism is emphasized. An example is described of a physical fight that broke out among group members of different cultures and resulted in several members dropping out of the group. The successful experience of a cultural awareness group is also described.

Group psychotherapy with Arab patients,"Group psychotherapy is a treatment modality in which specially selected patients are placed into a group guided by a trained therapist in order to help affect behavioral change and personality modification. This is achieved by using a variety of technical maneuvers and theoretical frameworks. The leader of the group uses group members' interactions in order to produce the desired change of goal. Early experiences of Arab participation within a group have been disappointing and have resulted in some therapists discontinuing this form of psychotherapy, and relying on individual approaches. The permissive attitude of having emotions expressed freely in the group and the use of a non-directive approach have led to conflicts within the patient and between patients in the group. These conflicts were difficult to resolve and ended many times in an angry withdrawal of patients and a few divorces within the patient groups. It is important to identify those aspects that might have a detrimental effect on interaction and a negative effect on group therapy. Techniques need to be modified in light of the culture to ensure an optimum outcome of therapy.

Use of a group counseling game to enhance social skills of children with learning disabilities,"Investigates the effectiveness of the Social Skills Game (SSG) of G. Berg (1989) in reducing social skills deficits in 66 3rd–6th grade children (aged 8–21 yrs) with learning disabilities (LDs). Skills taught by the SSG include self-reinforcement, causal attribution, performance mediation for anxiety and for mistakes, and expectations of efficacy and positive outcome. Ss were assigned to a treatment, placebo control, or control group. Results showed that treatment Ss were rated higher (posttest and 6-wks delayed posttest ratings combined) than control Ss on 3 subscales and total score of the Walker-McConnell Scale of Social Competence and School Adjustment. Findings suggest that the group process involved in SSG helps improve social skills of children with LDs.

Training Soviet immigrant therapists in the field of group psychotherapy,"Discusses characteristics of therapists who trained in the Soviet Union and immigrated to Israel and the authors' experience (1) in training Soviet immigrant psychiatrists in group therapy, (2) as therapists of a therapeutic group of professionals, and (3) in teaching psychodynamic group therapy for immigrant groups. The internalized representation of the group entity and other aspects arising from Soviet training affect the psychological world of the individual. The authors discuss relevant factors in training immigrants from the former Soviet Union and the most effective methods. Key issues include the therapists' unique experience of the inner world as a source of danger, defensive modes connected with this experience, their perception of authority as an agent of ideology, and their representation of the group as a persecutory entity and as a vehicle of indoctrination.

Group therapy of Aboriginal offenders in a Canadian forensic psychiatric facility,"Documents the use of group therapy for Aboriginal offenders in a forensic psychiatric facility, where this degree of cultural heterogeneity exists. In recent years, the use of group therapy approaches with Aboriginal or Native Canadians/American Indians has become widely accepted. Many advocates of this approach rarely consider the implications of group therapy for culturally heterogeneous groups, such as when non-Aboriginal peoples are involved or when there are Aboriginal peoples from different cultures and/or with different degrees of orientation to Euro-Canadian culture. Observations were made over 5-wks on a 24-person treatment unit of personality-disordered male offenders. It is concluded that group therapies that mirror the social, cultural, racial, and class structures of Euro-Canadian society are problematic in the treatment of traditional Aboriginal offenders, but much less so for acculturated Aboriginal offenders.

The impact of race and ethnicity on transference and countertransference in combined individual/group therapy,"Interracial group psychotherapy is workable. Psychodynamics get cathected onto race; as this paper will show, the group process elicits feelings about racial and ethnic differences with greater intensity than in individual therapy. Analysis of race/ethnicity can be both problematic and growth enhancing for treatment. The process of identifying conscious and unconscious feelings and thoughts of race/ethnicity can stimulate major resistance, which can engender difficulties in maintenance of a working alliance. However, the working through of these feelings/thoughts may have a catalytic effect and lead to a more rapid unfolding of core psychodynamic issues. Case material from a multi-racial/multi-ethnic therapy group illustrate these issues.

Group therapy with adolescents who have learning disabilities and social/emotional problems,"Describes psychodynamically informed group therapy designed for adolescents who have learning disabilities and social/emotional problems. The literature on psychosocial development and the interventions offered to these adolescents are reviewed. There is agreement in the literature that group therapy is beneficial for adolescents. Although learning disabled adolescents meet the criteria for receiving this intervention, the review suggests that this population is not generally offered group therapy. Two case examples highlight interactions that occur in group and raise issues that can be addressed in a group with adolescents who have learning disabilities. The group approach described combines principles derived from psychodynamic group theory with adjustments to accommodate the level of social competence displayed by group members.

Helping men change: A group counseling model for male clients,"Described a semistructured group counseling model designed to help male clients explore how the male gender role is experienced and expressed. Six male group members, aged 22–41 yrs, were provided with an opportunity to practice alternative behaviors in a supportive environment in 10 2-hr sessions. The model contains both a psychoeducational and an interpersonal, process-oriented component. Sessions 1–6 were structured and addressed issues of masculinity, emotions, work and identity, sexuality and intimacy, and family-of-origin. Sessions 7–20 were more unstructured. Two major issues of discussion were the painful struggle deep inside each group member and how the group interacted with each other, expressed in storytelling rather than direct expression of emotions. A Q-sort evaluation found the highest ranking therapeutic factors were universality, group cohesiveness, interpersonal learning, and catharsis.

Traumatization of group leaders in their work with displaced persons,"Describes the attempts of therapists in the Rijeka region of Croatia to help displaced persons with their experiences and their feelings of loss and abandonment. Groups were primarily women, children, and older men. Refugees were observed to be fearful of strangers, to expect others to look after all their needs, and to have great difficulty accepting any responsibility. Dealing with persons so traumatized eventually became very difficult for the therapists who shared their hardships and dangers in the shelters, and the therapists organized their own group meetings as a self-help measure. Different phases of the refugees' adaptation to exile are described.

Gender: A critical factor in a couples group,"Couples group therapy should be considered as a primary treatment for marital couples whose dysfunctional interaction is rigidified and chronic. A gender-linked perspective for treatment is developed which expands a psychodynamic approach underscoring power as one of the central issues in marital conflict. Clinical vignettes from couples groups illustrate this model. A gender orientation facilitates the psychodynamic group process, decreases unrealistic expectations of the spouse, and encourages greater acceptance of male/female and individual differences. In this setting, individuals are able to develop new and more functional modes of interaction with their spouses, which generate an increased sense of empowerment.

Traumatization of group leaders in their work with refugees,"Describes the development of a program to prevent the occurrence of psychic traumas in refugees. The personal traumas of the therapists who were leading groups of refugees in the program are discussed. Therapists' problems originated from specific reactions of traumatized people or from nearly uncertain and unforeseen conditions of life. Therapists also experienced problems with professional identity and the leadership role. Having to face human misfortune and meet psychotraumatized people also supposes a traumatization of group leaders that is especially strong when the leaders are exposed to their own traumatic situations.

Ss in a therapy group underwent group therapy in which they were encouraged to state their current feelings and recall traumas of the past. Five women served as a self-selected, no-treatment control group. Comparison of pre- and posttreatment measures showed significantly better perceived well-being and improved visual acuity in the treatment groups as compared to the control group.

Group therapy with Southeast Asian refugees,"Describes a 1-yr experience with group therapy for Southeast Asians treated in a psychiatric program for Indochinese refugees. Cultural factors involving communication styles, respect for authority, and traditional social relationships were found to influence the group process. Socialization experiences that encouraged traditional activities and practical information were the most acceptable medium by all groups. Psychological issues of losses, cultural conflicts, and persistent discussion of somatic symptoms were voiced throughout the activities. Formal group psychotherapy was periodically useful in some groups. Flexibility, meeting concrete needs, keeping a bicultural focus, and maintaining the individual therapy sessions contributed to patient acceptance.

Group Therapy with Disabled Young People: Effects of Modified Group-Analytic Techniques,"The activities described in this article took place in the largely closed world of a rehabilitation centre for disabled children and young people in Neckargemund, near Heidelberg, West Germany, with groups in the sixteen- to twenty-two-year age bracket. Most of these young people have multiple disabilities. There are a number of reasons for favouring group therapy among the range of approaches. The economic use of resources is one of them. Another reason for using the group as a psychotherapeutic tool is the way the institution is structured. Groups are needed to prepare a large number of the young adults for work. The group psychotherapy thus relates to the concrete theme of living together in the centre, by defining and accentuating the group as a medium, but also as a problem. The study shows the nature of the effects of special group-analytic procedure and how it differs from more complex group-analytic approaches. The emphasis is on communication and the matrix which changes with the history of the group. The goal is regression to the first stages of communication with and about these deficits, followed by a realistic 'readjustment' to the potentially complementary world about them. This is a process which, can only develop in a rehabilitation centre, that is, only in groups of disabled people.

Group psychotherapy in Japan today,"Discusses the various types of psychotherapy currently in use in Japan to treat psychiatric disorders, and suggests that the Japanese tendency to emphasize groups over individuals (groupism) favors the use of group psychotherapy with Japanese patients. Other cultural phenomena that also influence the effectiveness of group therapy are considered—issues of authority, confidentiality, gender, and the value of silence. It is suggested that the amount of influence that groupism has on psychotherapy is greater for patients with mild neurosis than for patients with severe psychosis. The mainstream of group psychotherapy in Japan presently has not been with neuroses but with schizophrenia and personality disorders.

The prevention-group model combines efforts to educate immigrants about the effects of life changes with efforts to teach skills that will help them cope more successfully with such changes. The small-group format is designed to be used with immigrant clients before migration or immediately after resettlement; it includes training in communication and cognitive coping skills. Israeli immigrants who participated in such a program reported increased social support networks, changes in cognitive coping with stressful situations, and greater satisfaction with interactions in their new cultures.

Investigating ethnic prejudices among boys and girls in a therapeutic community for maladjusted children and modifying some prejudices: Can basic prejudices be changed?,"Studied ethnic prejudices by administering a 10-item scale of interpersonal tolerance 4 times to 40 9–16 yr olds who were placed in a UK residential community because of maladjustments. Ss were either assigned to 1–2 weekly group therapy sessions on such topics as developing racial tolerance and received individual sessions or received no firm regime encouraging interracial tolerance. At 3 and 6 mo and on leaving the community, Ss in the experimental group showed increased racial/personal tolerance that was maintained and increased throughout the period. Possible reasons for the change in the experimental group include strong leadership, staff backing, and warm but firm treatment while modifying prejudices and including Ss in regular formal and informal discussions.

The effects of group counseling on self-concept and locus of control among learning disabled children,"60 8–11 yr old learning-disabled Ss were randomly assigned to 2 groups. 27 Ss in experimental subgroups participated in 8 group counseling sessions designed to teach Ss the skills necessary to eliminate behaviors and feelings that had been identified by the children as self-defeating. All Ss were administered the Dimensions of Self-Concept Scale and the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale 1 wk prior to treatment and posttreatment. MANOVA showed no differences between the groups' pretreatment, but significant differences were found in several areas after treatment. Experimental Ss had higher aspirations, lower levels of anxiety, and higher internal locus-of-control scores.

Verbal participation in group therapy: A comparative study on New Mexico ethnic groups,"Examined the verbal participation of 102 White, 126 Mexican-American, and 37 Native-American alcoholic inpatients in group therapy. 15 group sessions were observed over a 2.5-mo period, and data were analyzed in ethnic categories. Findings show that White Ss exhibited significantly higher verbal participation than the other 2 ethnic groups. Factors such as bilingualism, cultural marginality, and rural vs urban lifestyles are suggested to account for the differences in Ss' verbal participation. The need to reconsider the implications of homogeneous or heterogeneous ethnic groupings in therapy is also discussed.

Cross-cultural group counseling and the use of the sentence completion method,"Discusses the sentence completion method with cross-cultural group counseling to foster discussion and interaction among group members. It is noted that cross-cultural counseling focuses on culture, ethnicity, language, and milieu. Two strategies of cross-cultural counseling are ethnotherapy and cultural-milieu counseling. The sentence completion method is based on 2 assumptions: (1) individuals supply material about themselves when they respond to stimulus stems, and (2) responses to sentence stems are not monitored by the respondents and are unrelated to situational factors. Eight cross-cultural sentence stems are presented as group interaction stimulators to generate self-disclosure among group members. Two case examples of a Mexican-American woman and a White woman illustrate the use of these sentence stems in group counseling. Participants' feedback and the author's observations suggest that this merger of cross-cultural group counseling and sentence completion can be instrumental in the exploration and conceptual understanding of culture, ethnicity, and language.

Alice in Wonderland: The multi-racial small group in clinical practice,"In this paper presented at the spring meeting of the Transcultural Psychiatry Society, March 1983, the author examines the predicament of the fictional character ""Alice"" (L. Carroll's The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland ) in terms of system, selection criteria, group process, acting out, and the outcome. All efforts are made by the leader to change Alice's approach to the tea party. These observations are compared to the situation of hospital patients from Asia and the West Indies. An attempt at a small group setting for these Ss resulted in less tension, more confidence, and a greater expression of emotions.

Cognitive-behavioral group therapy for the depressed elderly: Issues and adaptations,"Presents 4 cases from an ongoing study comparing the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamic group psychotherapy in the treatment of depressed geriatric outpatients. Patients in the study were 55–78 yr old community residents who read about the project or were referred by physicians. The cases suggest that age changes in intellectual functioning may cause the therapy to proceed more slowly than expected and may make behavioral components the most useful aspects of the treatment for some people. Health status may affect the assessment of severity of depression as well as the pace of the treatment. Differences in cultural and educational experience may make it more difficult for the group to become cohesive. Passivity and negative stereotypes of aging need to be actively confronted.

Results contradict the notion that psychotherapy is of little or no use with gender-identity patients.

Veterans Administration cooperative study on aphasia: A comparison of individual and group treatment,"Five VA Medical Centers participated in an investigation designed to compare individual with group treatment for aphasic patients who had suffered a left hemisphere cerebral vascular accident. 67 40–79 yr old male patients were assigned to either traditional, individual, stimulus–response type treatment of specific language deficits or group therapy designed to improve communication through group interaction and discussion with no direct treatment of specific language deficits. All Ss received 8 hrs of therapy/week beginning at 4 wks post-onset and continuing until 48 wks post-onset or until they dropped out of the study. A battery of language measures and a clinical neurologic evaluation were administered at intake and every 11 wks a patient was in the study. Results show that both individually and group-treated Ss made significant improvement in language abilities. Individual treatment resulted in significantly better overall performance on the Porch Index of Communicative Ability. If the traditional belief is correct that significant spontaneous recovery is complete by 3–6 mo post-onset, significant improvement in both groups beyond 26 wks post-onset indicates both individual and group treatment are efficacious methods for managing aphasic patients.

Psychosocial competence differences among adolescents on entering group counseling,"The psychosocial competence characteristics of 245 high school students were assessed on a battery of tests including Rotter's Internal–External Locus of Control Scale, the Rotter Trust Scale, and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale as they entered group counseling. Differences in race, sex, and status as an exemplary or marginal student confirmed that different groups were functioning in significantly different ways. Differences in status as exemplary and marginal students supported F. B. Tyler's (1973, 1978) tripartite competence configuration of self-attitudes, world-attitudes, and behavioral attributes. Social desirability orientation was also a component of effective functioning. Exemplary (""getting their lives together well and handling school well"") students' characteristics provided a model of effective functioning against which to judge improvement. They were more internal and more active copers than marginals; further, for them internality, trust, social desirability, and active coping style were correlated. Black students were more active copers than Whites, more social-desirability oriented, and more system-blaming with regard to prejudice. They were not less trusting, yet for them system blame was negatively related to trust, social desirability, and internality. These differences suggest that Blacks were actively trying to discover the rules that would permit them to survive in a perceived alien environment.

Group therapy with gender-dysphoric patients,"Describes a 2-yr study utilizing expressive dynamic group psychotherapy with gender-dysphoric patients. The group was biracial and included both male and female patients requesting sex reassignment surgery. During 101 sessions, a total of 18 patients aged 17–45 yrs were treated. After an initial period of intense acting out, the group began to function as a traditional therapy group. By utilizing the dynamics of the group's excitement, the patients' rigid defenses were challenged and a therapeutic alliance established. Specific therapeutic strategies for dealing with this patient population are discussed, including the necessity of employing co-therapists to deal with the patients' psychologic defenses of splitting and projection. Follow-up data on the group members are presented. A number of the patients either have decided against surgery or have postponed it as a result of the therapy. Others who underwent the surgery have asked to continue in therapy.

"Goal attainment, locus of control, and coping style in adolescent group counseling","15 high school counselors conducted small group counseling sessions with 218 students. Client characteristics included sex, race, and competence as perceived by the counselor. Multiple measures of outcome included goal attainment (Kiresuk-Sherman Goal Attainment Scaling), locus of control (Rotter's Internal–External Locus of Control Scale—I–E), and coping style (Tyler Behavioral Attributes of Psychosocial Competence). Multiple perspectives on outcome were provided by independent student and counselor goal attainment ratings. Students attained both personal and educational goals. Although counselors viewed internal students as achieving more goals, moderate I–E generally predicted goal attainment. Blacks differed from Whites in that externals gained the most goals. ""Planfulness"" of coping style was related to both student- and counselor-rated goal attainment, and students who attained most goals also responded most ""planfully"" on the postcounseling assessment of coping style. Results suggest that counseling should include teaching ""planful"" problem solving, and it should not overemphasize the students' internality. Finally, ways are suggested concerning how counseling approaches might be varied in relation to students' race and existing competencies.

"Group psychotherapy with a paraplegic group, with an emphasis on specific problems of sexuality","Describes a group therapy program conducted for a group of paraplegic patients—4 Black females, 1 White female, and 12 Black males, average age 24 yrs. Patients came from underprivileged backgrounds, had been involved in conflicts with ward staff members and other patients, were confined to wheel chairs, and had varying functional ability in their upper bodies. The group was organized to increase participant adaptation to hospitalization and to functioning in the outside world after release. Sexual capacity was a major focus of concern, and group leaders provided information as well as facilitated discussions by members of their feelings. Lack of sexual satisfaction appeared to be a significantly greater problem for males than for females; however, it is suggested that females may have felt socially constrained from discussing their sexual concerns.

Group psychotherapy with homosexuals: A review,"Comprehensively reviews the clinical literature dealing with group treatment of homosexuals. A favorable outcome of group therapy was reported in almost all cases whether the goal was one of achieving a change in sexual orientation or a reduction in the associated problems. It was found that homosexuals who are treated in mostly heterosexual groups are no more likely to terminate treatment prematurely than their heterosexual counterparts or homosexuals treated in homosexual therapy groups. Results are discussed in terms of comparisons of the 2 group therapy settings.

The program included a tutorial reading program, biweekly group counseling, and cultural enrichment. TOTE (a performance-demonstrated instructional management system) and cash-redeemable tokens were used to facilitate reading progress. Cash was given for attendance at the group counseling sessions, led by more advanced Black students. Change in reading scores (measured by the Gilmore Oral Reading Test), teacher evaluations, and change in probationary status suggest that appropriate intervention programs can solve problem behavior.

An evaluation study of a group therapy procedure with reservation adolescent Indians,"Describes a group therapy experience with Indian youths of high-school age, referred by school counselors because of delinquency or truancy. Efforts to obtain spontaneous personal discussion were impeded by cultural factors, and the white middle-class therapists sustained group participation by paying for attendance and by presenting topics for discussion. Group participation increased as the focus of discussion shifted to issues involving the exploitation of Indians and as the group challenged the motivation of the therapists. Follow-up data revealed a marked drop in the number of arrests and school absences of the group members. It is concluded that group therapy is feasible in spite of significant cultural-psychological contraindications associated with Indian participants who are juvenile delinquents.

Cultural factors in group counseling and interaction,"Discusses ways in which the group counselor can help the Asian-American client to be more expressive in communicating his feelings and thoughts to the group without negating his cultural values. These values, which include reliance on will power, tendency to avoid confrontation, humility, and fear of shaming the family, not only limit the Asian-American's verbal and nonverbal communication, but are often misinterpreted by Caucasians who may view the person as unfeeling, conforming, and obsequious. Eliciting responses and perceptions from the Asian-American is felt to be both educational and therapeutic.

Experiences with group psychotherapy in Taiwan,"Evaluates the results of 3 projects on group psychotherapy carried out in 3 mental institutions in Taiwan. These projects were (a) group therapeutic approach in a male disturbed ward in a provincial mental hospital as a pilot study for application of group psychotherapy in Taiwan; (b) investigation of cultural implications in group processes engendered in 3 groups 1 all male, 1 all female, and 1 mixed with the same male therapist in a private charity mental hospital; and (c) methodological consideration of group psychotherapy by comparing regularity of patients' attendance at interview group psychotherapy, occupational therapy with group orientation, and didactic group therapy in a psychiatric ward of a general hospital. The universal phenomena in the social structure of patients' subgrouping in psychiatric wards and the applicability of group interview methods in psychiatric treatment of the mentally ill in Taiwan were explored. Cultural implications of group processes, group discussions, intragroup relationships, and communicative tools in group psychotherapy were also studied, and some modifications in therapeutic techniques are suggested.

Group therapy with retarded readers,"The author selected, from members of a class in remedial reading, 12 children of whom each was matched with a control pupil for age, Wechsler IQ, and reading ability on the Gates tests. All were more than 3 years retarded in reading and all continued in a regular course in remedial reading. For 6 months the experimental group met with the author for therapeutic group discussion. Retests after this period showed that this group had made an average reading gain of 11.5 months, as compared with an 8.25 month gain made by the controls. It is concluded that for these subjects the psychotherapeutic value of the group discussion was an important factor in the correction of reading difficulties. 22 references.

Group therapy in overcoming racial and cultural tensions,"The therapeutic group, directed toward helping the individual as a whole in his emotional difficulties, can also be effective in overcoming racial and cultural tensions because the therapy group is a formed group, and therefore offers an excellent opportunity for children to meet interracial or intercultural situations they might otherwise want to avoid, This contact is a close one, since the groups are small and share activities of great variety, The permission of free expression of feelings, negative and positive, in the presence of an accepting adult makes it possible to bring feelings into the open so that the children can be helped to work through these emotions, Change is often brought about through the wish to identify with the accepting adult and through status gained among contemporaries, The worker is both psychiatrically oriented and aware of cultural and racial factors in emotional disturbances.
